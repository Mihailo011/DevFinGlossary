The .eu TLD is additional to those that already exist within the EU, and does not replace them. It gives users the option of having a Europe-wide internet identity. For citizens, the .eu TLD is a place in cyberspace where their rights as consumers and individuals are governed by EU rules and standards. For companies or other organisations, a .eu website gives them internet visibility within the EU and beyond its borders, advertising their Europe-wide status. This contributes to an increase in e-commerce presence. A registry is designated by the European Commission. It organises, administers and manages the .eu TLD in the general interest and is responsible for its high quality, transparency, security, stability, predictability, reliability, accessibility, efficiency and non-discrimination. It also ensures a level playing field and consumer protection, and makes sure that abusive domain name registrations are quickly identified. It works closely with competent authorities and other public bodies responsible for cybersecurity and information security, such as national computer emergency response teams.

These criteria were defined at a European Council meeting in Copenhagen in 1993. The Copenhagen criteria are the following. 1.Political, requiring stable democratic institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and protection of minorities. 2. Economic, requiring a functioning market economy and the capacity to cope with competitive forces in the EU. 3. The ability to take on the obligations of membership. Accession negotiations with a candidate country are launched after unanimous agreement by all Member States endorsed by the European Council. Negotiations take place in intergovernmental conferences between the governments of the EU Member States and that of the candidate country. Negotiations serve to help the candidate countries to prepare for EU membership. When negotiations on all policy areas are completed, and the EU itself is satisfied that it is itself prepared for enlargement in terms of absorption capacity, the terms and conditions — including possible safeguard clauses and transitional arrangements — are incorporated in an accession treaty. This treaty needs the European Parliament's consent and the Council's unanimous approval before all EU Member States and the candidate country can sign it. The contracting parties then ratify it in line with their respective constitutional rules.

A country is granted candidate country status by the European Council following an opinion from the European Commission, drawn up following that country's application for EU membership.

During its accession process, the candidate country demonstrates that it meets the accession (Copenhagen) criteria and is able to take on the rights and obligations of EU membership. Depending on the specific situation, the candidate country will need to see through a deep reform process, for instance by improving its infrastructure and administrative capacities with a view to implementing new legislation in line with the body of EU laws and standards (known as the acquis).

Article 268 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) states that the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union is exclusive in disputes relating to compensation for damage against the EU. In other words, it is not possible to sue the EU before Member States' national or international courts. The second and third paragraphs of Article 340 TFEU refer to the liability of the EU for public torts (or wrongs), in the form of action for damages against the EU. They state that, in accordance with the general principles common to the laws of the Member States, the EU must make good any damage caused by its institutions or by its servants in the performance of their duties. Although an action for damages is, in principle, intended to award compensation for the damage suffered, it may also be aimed solely at establishing that the EU is liable, by means of an interlocutory judgment (a provisional judgment given at an intermediate stage where the damage cannot yet be quantified). Such an action is an independent remedy, in particular in relation to the action for annulment or the action for failure to act. Consequently, the inadmissibility of an action for annulment does not in itself entail the inadmissibility of an action for damages. An action for damages must be filed within 5 years of the occurrence of the harmful event. The limitation period can be interrupted in either of two situations: if an application initiating proceedings is lodged with the Court of Justice or the Tribunal; if the victim makes a prior application to the competent institution. In the latter case, the application must be made within 2 months or, if the institution concerned fails to respond, under the conditions laid down for bringing an action for failure to act. The lodging of an appeal before a national court does not constitute a ground for interrupting the limitation period. As for the Court deciding on the admissibility of the action, this is conditional on the fact, on the one hand, that the damage is attributable to an institution and, on the other hand, that it was caused by an institution or one of its staff in the performance of their duties. With respect to the substantive conditions for engaging the EU's extra-contractual liability, the claimant must prove that all three of the following elements cumulatively prevail: illegal conduct of the institutions or their servants, in the light of EU law (conduct consisting of a positive action or an omission or abstention); the existence of real and certain damage; the existence of a causal link between the conduct and the damage claimed.

While certain actions can be taken to mitigate climate change (to avoid and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, which leads to global warming), other actions need to be taken in order to adapt to climate change. Adapting to climate change involves changing our behaviour and ways of doing things to prepare for the unavoidable, so as to be able to protect ourselves, the environment and the economy from the impacts of climate change. In February 2021, the European Commission published an EU climate adaptation strategy. This aims to complement the various actions taken by the EU to mitigate climate change by defining a strategy to adapt to the effects of climate change. It also seeks to help make the EU not only climate neutral (with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions) but also climate resilient by 2050. The strategy has the following four main objectives. Smarter adaptation. Actions taken must be informed by robust data and risk assessment tools that are available to all. Faster adaptation. We need to adapt more quickly and comprehensively and to focus on developing and rolling out solutions to help reduce climate-related risk, increase climate protection and safeguard the availability of fresh water. More systemic adaptation. Since climate change will have impacts at all levels of society and across all sectors of the economy, adaptation actions must also be systemic. The strategy will support the further development and implementation of adaptation strategies and plans at all levels of governance, giving priority to integrating adaptation into macro-fiscal policy, nature-based solutions for adaptation and local adaptation action. Stepping up international action on adaptation to climate change. Carried out by scaling up international finance and through stronger global engagement and exchanges on adaptation. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change glossary from 2018 includes the following definitions. Adaptation. In human systems, the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In natural systems, the process of adjustment to actual climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects. Resilience. The capacity of social, economic and environmental systems to cope with a hazardous event or trend or disturbance, responding or reorganising in ways that maintain their essential function, identity and structure while also maintaining the capacity for adaptation, learning and transformation.

{"Source Name": "NATOLlN4 CAPACITY BUILDING - GLOSSARY", "Type of Source": "WebPage", "Source URL": "https://natolin4cb.eu/glossary/agreement/#", "Term": "Agreement", "Acronym": null, "Definition": "The term \"agreement\" can have a generic and a specific meaning. It also has acquired a special meaning in the law of regional economic integration. (a) Agreement as a generic term: The 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties employs the term \"international agreement\" in its broadest sense. On the one hand, it defines treaties as \"international agreements\" with certain characteristics. On the other hand, it employs the term \"international agreements\" for instruments, which do not meet its definition of \"treaty\". Its Art.3 refers also to \"international agreements not in written form\". Although such oral agreements may be rare, they can have the same binding force as treaties, depending on the intention of the parties. An example of an oral agreement might be a promise made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of one State to his counterpart of another State. The term \"international agreement\" in its generic sense consequently embraces the widest range of international instruments. (b) Agreement as a particular term: \"Agreements\" are usually less formal and deal with a narrower range of subject-matter than \"treaties\". There is a general tendency to apply the term \"agreement\" to bilateral or restricted multilateral treaties. It is employed especially for instruments of a technical or administrative character, which are signed by the representatives of government departments, but are not subject to ratification. Typical agreements deal with matters of economic, cultural, scientific and technical cooperation. Agreements also frequently deal with financial matters, such as avoidance of double taxation, investment guarantees or financial assistance. The UN and other international organizations regularly conclude agreements with the host country to an international conference or to a session of a representative organ of the Organization. Especially in international economic law, the term \"agreement\" is also used as a title for broad multilateral agreements (e.g. the commodity agreements). The use of the term \"agreement\" slowly developed in the first decades of this century. Nowadays by far the majority of international instruments are designated as agreements. (c) Agreements in regional integration schemes: Regional integration schemes are based on general framework treaties with constitutional character. International instruments which amend this framework at a later stage (e.g. accessions, revisions) are also designated as \"treaties\". Instruments that are concluded within the framework of the constitutional treaty or by the organs of the regional organization are usually referred to as \"agreements\", in order to distinguish them from the constitutional treaty. For example, whereas the Treaty of Rome of 1957 serves as a quasi-constitution of the European Community, treaties concluded by the EC with other nations are usually designated as agreements. Also, the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA) was established by the Treaty of Montevideo of 1980, but the sub regional instruments entered into under its framework are called agreements.", "Related": [], "Referenced Source": "Treaties Office Database", "Synonym": null}

These rules reflect the five freedoms contained in the Council of Europe's Convention for the Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes: freedom from hunger and thirst; freedom from discomfort; freedom from pain, injury and disease; freedom to express normal behaviour; freedom from fear and distress. Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU stipulates that, as sentient beings, full regard should be paid to animals' welfare requirements. Since 1974, when the first EU legislation on animal welfare was adopted, animal welfare requirements have evolved based on sound scientific knowledge, improving the quality of animals' lives in accordance with citizens' expectations and market demands. Today, animal welfare is at the heart of sustainability, as a good level of animal welfare is linked to less antibiotic use, healthier animals entering the food chain and reduced transmission of diseases from animals to people. Animal welfare, as a key contribution to a sustainable livestock production, is an essential element of the 'Farm to fork' strategy, adopted by the European Commission in May 2020 in the context of the European Green Deal. Within its framework, the Commission will revise the animal welfare legislation to align it with the latest scientific evidence, broaden its scope, make it easier to enforce and ultimately ensure a higher level of animal welfare. The conclusions from the evaluation of the EU strategy for the protection and welfare of animals 2012–2015 will be used in this context. The Commission will also consider options for animal welfare labelling to better transmit value through the food chain. While animal welfare is mainly dealt with at EU level, it does not fall within its exclusive competence. Topics such as the use of animals in shows, cultural or sporting events are the responsibility of EU countries at national level.

Each year the strategy is presented by the European Commission in late autumn and, following discussions within the Parliament and the Council, forms the basis of EU guidance for national growth and employment policies. Starting from the 2020 European semester cycle, it focuses on four aspects: environmental sustainability, productivity, fairness, and macroeconomic stability. As part of the European semester's autumn cycle, the Commission also publishes at the same time as the ASGS a draft joint employment report, which analyses the EU's employment situation and how EU countries are addressing it, and an alert mechanism report, which looks for potential economic imbalances requiring policy action, and provides a recommendation for the euro area.

The CJEU can review the legality of: legislative acts such as regulations, decisions and directives; acts of the Council, of the Commission and of the European Central Bank, other than recommendations and opinions; acts of the European Parliament and of the European Council intended to produce legal effects vis-à-vis third parties; and acts of EU bodies, offices or agencies intended to produce legal effects vis-à-vis third parties. Actions for annulment may be brought by the following three types of applicant. Privileged applicants. The EU countries, the European Parliament, the Council and the European Commission may bring an action for annulment purely in the interests of legality, without proving any particular interest. Semi-privileged applicants. The European Central Bank, the European Court of Auditors and the European Committee of the Regions may bring an action for annulment only to protect their own prerogatives. Non-privileged applicants. All individuals and legal persons, including regional or local governments, may bring an action for annulment only if they prove that the contested act is addressed to them or, if it is not addressed to them, that it is of direct and individual concern to them. They may also bring such an action against a regulatory act that is of direct concern to them and does not entail implementing measures. Grounds for the annulment of an act include: lack of competence; infringement of an essential procedural requirement; infringement of the EU treaties or of the Charter of Fundamental Rights; infringement of any rule of law relating to the application of the treaties; and the misuse of powers. Effects of annulment. When the CJEU rules that an act is void, the effect of annulment is generally from the point of the adoption of the act in question (ex tunc) but may also be from the date of the CJEU's judgment (ex nunc). In addition, the CJEU may rule to maintain the effects of the annulled act. The author of the annulled act must take the necessary measures to comply with the CJEU's judgment.

The contract defines the applicable law or laws chosen by the parties (which are, in principle, national laws) and the conditions under which an action can be brought. In the context of European Union (EU) law, an action could be brought before the Court of Justice or the General Court based on an arbitration clause contained in a contract concluded by or on behalf of the EU, whether governed by public or private law, which expressly provides (by way of derogation from the rules of ordinary law under which disputes arising out of such contracts are subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the EU Member States) for jurisdiction to be exercised by one or other of the courts making up the Court of Justice of the European Union. Thus, under Article 272 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the Court of Justice of the European Union is able to give judgment pursuant to any arbitration clause contained in a contract concluded by or on behalf of the EU, whether that contract be governed by public or private law. Where there is a dispute between Member States which relates to the subject matter of the EU treaties and this dispute is submitted to the Court of Justice under a special agreement between the parties, the Court has jurisdiction, according to Article 273 TFEU. Disputes to which the EU is a party are not to be excluded from the jurisdiction of the courts or tribunals of the Member States on that ground, except where jurisdiction is conferred on the EU courts by the treaties (under Article 274 TFEU). Article 340(1) TFEU states that the EU's contractual liability is to be governed by the law applicable to the contract in question. The application initiating proceedings based on an arbitration clause, which can only be submitted by the parties to the contract (because third parties are not able to bring proceedings before the EU courts by virtue of such a clause), must be accompanied by a copy of the contract in question (Article 78(3) of the rules of procedure of the General Court). If the arbitration clause does not provide for any restriction to this effect, the court seized, as the contract court, has extensive powers to examine, in fact and in law, all aspects of the dispute submitted to it by the parties and, where appropriate, to order all necessary measures requested by the latter. The court may: interpret certain provisions of the contract in the light of the applicable law; be seized of the proper performance of their contractual obligations by the parties and may, as such, compel them to perform their contractual obligations or to compensate the injured party, by ordering them to pay damages, if the non-performance of these obligations has led to damage; require the parties to pay for additional services not initially provided for in the contract; order the judicial termination of the contract in case of non-performance, specifying the consequences of such a termination. The EU courts may also be called upon to rule on the validity of the contract and may then declare it invalid.

This is an area in which the free movement of persons is ensured in conjunction with appropriate measures with respect to external border controls, asylum, immigration and preventing and combating crime. An entire section of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), Title V (Articles 67-89), is devoted to the EU's area of freedom, security and justice. It contains general rules (Articles 67-76), as well as specific chapters concerning: policies on border checks, asylum and immigration judicial cooperation in civil matters judicial cooperation in criminal matters police cooperation. Article 67 TFEU states that the EU seeks to ensure a high level of security through measures to prevent and combat crime, racism and xenophobia, and through coordination and cooperation measures between police and judicial authorities and other competent authorities, as well as through the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters and, if necessary, through the approximation of EU Member States' criminal laws. Because many security challenges come from outside the EU or are of a cross-border nature, individual Member States are not always best equipped to address them. Article 68 TFEU gives the European Council the responsibility of drawing up the strategic guidelines for legislative and operational planning within the area of freedom, security and justice. However, Member States remain responsible for maintaining law and order and safeguarding their internal security. Article 83 TFEU gives the European Parliament and the Council the right to draw up minimum rules defining criminal offences for particularly serious crimes with a cross-border dimension, resulting from the nature or impact of such offences or from a special need to combat them on a common basis. The crimes in question are: terrorism; human trafficking and the sexual exploitation of women and children; illicit drug and arms trafficking; money laundering; corruption; counterfeiting of means of payment; computer crime; organised crime.

Investors can also put the funds they receive from the Eurosystem into other assets. That pushes those asset prices up and yields down. Lower bond yields mean firms can finance investments more cheaply by issuing bonds, and banks are encouraged to make more loans to people and businesses, at lower rates. Asset purchases also send a signal about the ECB's intention to keep financing conditions favourable, reducing uncertainty about future interest rate developments.

It replaced the 1989 'television without frontiers' directive. The directive contains rules on EU-wide coordination of national legislation on all audiovisual media (whether television or on-demand services). It includes aspects such as the protection of minors, a prohibition on incitement to hatred, accessibility needs of people with a visual or hearing disability and rules on advertising and product placement. The Contact Committee brings together EU countries' representatives to monitor the implementation of the directive and the developments in the sector. In 2014, the European Commission established a European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services to advise it on the directive's implementation.

The aim is to ensure that any resolution is financed first by a bank's shareholders and, if necessary, also partly by its creditors. However, there is an additional funding source available — the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) — which can step in if stakeholders' and creditors' contributions are insufficient.

It covers all living things, ranging from bacteria, plants and animals, to humans. Biodiversity plays a vital role in ecosystem services, which are the services that nature supplies. These include pollination, climate regulation, flood protection, soil fertility and the supply of food, fuel, fibre and medicines. Since the 2000s, the EU has adopted a series of biodiversity action plans and strategies, the latest of which is the 2030 biodiversity strategy, designed to put Europe's biodiversity back on the path to recovery by 2030. The strategy, part of the European Green Deal, contains targets and commitments to tackle the main causes of biodiversity loss: land- and sea-use changes, the overexploitation of biological resources, climate change, pollution, invasive alien species. EU biodiversity-related legislation includes: the birds directive (Directive 2009/147/EC), which provides comprehensive protection to all wild bird species naturally occurring in the EU; the habitats directive (Directive 92/43/EEC), which helps maintain biodiversity by protecting over 1,000 animal and plant species and over 200 types of habitat; the water framework directive (Directive 2000/60/EC), which provides a framework for EU action in the field of water policy; the marine strategy framework directive (Directive 2008/56/EC), which provides a framework for EU action in the field of marine environmental policy; invasive alien species — animals and plants introduced accidentally or deliberately into a natural environment where they are not normally found, with serious negative consequences for their new environment (Regulation (EU) No 1143/2014); rules on wildlife trade (Regulation (EC) No 338/97 implementing the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, and going beyond the convention's requirements, Regulation (EC) No 1007/2009 on trade in seal products and Regulation (EEC) No 3254/91 on humane trapping standards).

{"Source Name": "eur-lex.europa.eu", "Type of Source": "WebPage", "Source URL": "https://eur-lex.europa.eu/EN/legal-content/glossary/border-checks.html#", "Term": "Border checks", "Acronym": null, "Definition": "Article 77 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union requires the European Union (EU) to develop a policy on border checks of persons and the efficient monitoring of the external borders, the absence of controls on persons at the internal borders and the gradual introduction of an integrated border-management system for the external borders. 22 EU Member States are members of the Schengen area, an area comprising those Member States along with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. There are no internal border controls between these countries. Together, they seek to attain the objective of improving security through efficient external border controls, while still facilitating the access of persons who have a legitimate reason to enter the EU. Border checks of persons still remain between those EU Member States which are not members of the Schengen area (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Ireland and Romania) and those which are (for example, for an individual travelling from Ireland, which is not part of the Schengen area, to France, which is). European integrated border management is underpinned in Regulation (EU) 2019/1896 on the European Border and Coast Guard. Member States have drafted national strategies to ensure and facilitate the practical application of this concept. One of its central components aims at supporting Member States' implementation of efficient border controls at the EU's external borders. Rules on crossing EU borders — both internal and external — are set out in the Schengen Borders Code (Regulation (EU) 2016/399), which also defines the main terms relating to this subject, including border control, border checks and border surveillance. When crossing external borders, non-EU nationals are subject to thorough checks in accordance with the conditions of entry into the country, including the systematic consultation of relevant databases, such as the Schengen Information System (SIS), and a check of the Visa Information System, if the person is subject to the visa obligation. EU nationals are also subject to border checks in the SIS for security purposes. The legal framework on the SIS was upgraded in 2018. The changes to the system, including new functionalities and data, will come into operation in early 2022. An automated centralised electronic Entry/Exit System (EES) for non-EU nationals crossing the EU's external borders for a short stay was introduced under Regulation (EU) 2017/2226 on smart borders. The EES records and stores the person's name, type of travel document, biometric data (fingerprints and captured facial images) and the date and place of entry and exit, in full respect of fundamental rights and data protection. It will also record refusals of entry, and generate alerts to Schengen countries when the authorised stay has expired. The EU has created an automated IT system called the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), which is designed to identify security, irregular migration or high epidemic risks posed by visa-exempt visitors travelling to the Schengen states for short-term stays prior to their trip. At the same time, ETIAS will facilitate border crossings for the vast majority of travellers who do not pose such risks. When ETIAS comes into force, nationals of over 60 countries will be eligible to apply for a travel authorisation. Operational cooperation between EU Member States to ensure the integrated management of the EU's borders takes place within the European Border and Coast Guard (comprising the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) and the Member States' border management authorities). A short-stay visa may be issued by one of the Schengen states. It entitles its holder to travel throughout the Schengen states for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. A list of countries whose citizens require a visa is annexed to Regulation (EU) 2018/1806. The EU's borders policy is part of the Schengen acquis (agreement and convention) and applies to Member States and the Schengen-associated countries (Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein) in accordance with Protocol 19. Ireland does not participate in measures of the Schengen acquis relating to borders.

This is applicable to a wide range of policy areas, except for those areas where EU Member States' national sovereignty is considered to be of paramount importance (e.g. foreign policy, immigration and justice), and decisions are generally adopted unanimously by means of the special legislative procedure. Nevertheless, when it extended the ordinary legislative procedure and qualified majority voting, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) also introduced a system of brake clauses. This system allows for situations where a Member State may submit an appeal to the European Council if it considers a legislative proposal to be of particular concern, and the legislative procedure is then put on hold. The legislative procedure can resume within 4 months if the Member State's concerns can be accommodated or, if this is not possible, it is either shelved or the European Commission publishes a new legislative proposal. The braking mechanism comes into play in the following three policy areas: Article 48 TFEU on measures for coordinating social security systems for migrant workers; Article 82(3) TFEU on judicial cooperation in criminal matters having a cross-border dimension; Article 83(3) TFEU on establishing common rules for certain criminal offences. In the latter two instances, if no consensus is reached, and if at least nine Member States wish to establish enhanced cooperation on the basis of the draft directive concerned, they must notify the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission accordingly.

The guidelines are subject to a multilateral surveillance mechanism that aims to ensure that EU countries comply with them. The Council formulates a non-binding recommendation on broad guidelines for the economic policies of EU countries and may make public recommendations where a country's economic policies are not consistent with the BEPGs. Article 121 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union requires EU countries to regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern and coordinate them within the Council. In 2010, the BEPGs were brought together with the employment guidelines under the single heading of integrated guidelines (IGs), and are the basis of the European employment strategy. The IGs are the main instrument for coordinating EU countries' reform efforts in the area of labour market and social policies.

The latest MFF covers the 2014-2020 period. The budget is funded from the EU's 'own resources' (i.e. a proportion of each EU country's gross national income, and a share of their receipts from VAT, customs duties and other levies). Each year, the European Commission submits a preliminary draft budget to the Council and the European Parliament, which share budgetary authority. The Council has to adopt its position on the draft budget by 1 October of the year preceding that for which the budget is proposed. If the Parliament approves the Council's position, the budget is adopted. If, however, the European Parliament adopts amendments to the Council's position, the Conciliation Committee is convened in order to find an agreement. The President of Parliament has the role of declaring final adoption of the budget. All the Union's revenue and expenditure is entered in the Community budget on the basis of annual forecasts.

This means a system where products are reused, repaired, remanufactured or recycled. Actions on the circular economy also contribute to other key EU priorities, including a green recovery, climate mitigation and energy savings, biodiversity protection, and global efforts on sustainable development. In 2015, the European Commission adopted an ambitious circular economy action plan. It announced 54 measures along the entire lifecycle of products to accelerate EU's transition towards a circular economy. All these measures have been adopted. Amongst other measures, revised EU legislation on waste entered into force in 2018. It set out clear recycling targets and a long-term plan for modern waste management. This included: targets for recycling of municipal and packaging waste; binding targets to reduce landfill to a maximum limit; measures to reduce food waste and marine litter. Also in 2018 there were further initiatives such as an EU strategy on plastics, a report on critical raw materials in the circular economy, rules on single-use plastics and proposed legislation on minimum requirements for water reuse (adopted in 2020). In March 2020, as a core building block of its 2019 European Green Deal to boost the efficient use of resources by moving to a clean, circular economy, restore biodiversity and cut pollution, the Commission adopted a new circular economy action plan for the EU. This includes measures to: make sustainable products the norm in the EU; give more power to consumers and public buyers; focus on the sectors that use most resources and where the potential for circularity is high, such as: electronics and ICT, batteries and vehicles, packaging, plastics and textiles, construction and buildings, food, water and nutrients; ensure less waste; make the circular economy work for people, regions and cities; lead global efforts on circular economy.

Along with the deployment of forces and equipment in response to an emergency, it also involves the planning and preparation for such events. This includes carrying out risk assessments and agreeing on protection and rescue plans and procedures. European Union (EU) action in the area of civil protection is covered by Article 196 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and aims to: support and complement EU Member States' actions at national, regional and local levels in risk prevention, in preparing their civil-protection personnel and in responding to natural and human-induced disasters; promote swift, effective operational cooperation between national civil protection services; and promote consistency in international civil protection work. Civil protection at the EU level is governed by the secondary legislation, Decision No 1313/2013/EU, forming the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM). The legal base was recently amended twice in order to strengthen the EU's collective capacity to prevent, prepare for and respond to disasters, and lately to respond more rapidly and effectively to future crises with cross-border implications, such as the COVID-19 crisis (Decision (EU) 2019/420 and Regulation (EU) 2021/836). The flagship policy of the recent revision of the UCPM is the establishment of rescEU. RescEU is a reserve of additional European response capacities that can be deployed as assistance when Member States are overwhelmed by a disaster. While EU civil protection cooperation falls under EU internal policies and actions, it has a very important external component: the UCPM may also be activated in case of disasters affecting non-EU countries. Apart from Member States, the UCPM is open to the participation of non-EU countries: European Free Trade Association countries which are members of the European Economic Area, acceding countries, candidate countries and potential candidates and other European countries. To date, the UCPM has 6 participating states: Iceland, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and Turkey. Under Article 222 of the TFEU (solidarity clause), if a Member State is the object of a terrorist attack or the victim of a natural or human-induced disaster and its authorities request help, the EU must come to its assistance by mobilising all instruments at its disposal. Coordination must be ensured in the Council of the European Union.

Examples of such organisations include: social partners (trades unions and employers' groups); non-governmental organisations (e.g. for environmental and consumer protection); grassroots organisations (e.g. youth and family groupings). The European Economic and Social Committee represents workers' and employers' organisations at the EU level and has a vital role in the lawmaking process of the EU.

These efforts involve reducing greenhouse gas emissions (climate mitigation) and/or taking action to prepare for and adjust to both the current effects of climate change and the predicted impacts in the future (climate adaptation). Since the 1990s, the European Union has been at the forefront of international negotiations on climate change and played an important role in the development of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and the negotiation of the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. To prevent climate change from reaching dangerous levels, the international community has agreed that global warming must be kept to well below 2 degreesC above pre-industrial levels and to aim to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degreesC. The EU is working hard to cut its emissions and to encourage other major polluters to take action. The EU is already on track to meet its greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for 2020, and the Commission has put forward a plan to further cut emissions by at least 55% by 2030. The EU aims to be climate neutral by 2050. Climate action, and in particular the cutting of greenhouse gas emissions, is a key element of the European Green Deal. Initiatives under the Green Deal include: a European Climate Law to enshrine the aim of being climate neutral by 2050 into EU law; a European Climate Pact to involve citizens and all parts of society in climate action; a 2030 Climate Target Plan to further reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030; an EU Strategy on Climate Adaptation to make Europe a climate-resilient society by 2050, fully adapted to the unavoidable impacts of climate change.

According to Article 39 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the CAP aims to: increase agricultural productivity by promoting technical progress and ensuring the optimum use of the factors of production, in particular labour; ensure a fair standard of living for farmers; stabilise markets; ensure the availability of supplies; ensure reasonable prices for consumers. With the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF), the CAP helps the EU's farmers to provide a secure supply of safe, healthy and affordable food by providing income support to farmers. It also funds measures to support and stabilise agricultural markets. The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) finances Member States' rural development programmes. Most decisions on agriculture are taken by means of the ordinary legislative procedure since the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty (Articles 42(1) and 43(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union). The CAP is now almost 60 years old. It is undergoing its sixth major reform, with the new CAP to apply from the beginning of 2023. Its share of the EU budget has steadily fallen in the last 30 years from 73% in 1985 to 31% for 2021-2027. The new CAP aims to foster a sustainable and competitive agricultural sector that can support the livelihoods of farmers and provide healthy and sustainable food for society, along with vibrant rural areas. Agriculture and rural areas are central to the European Green Deal, and the new CAP will be a key tool in reaching the ambitions of the farm-to-fork and biodiversity strategies.

With the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam (1999), the European Union also has a new instrument at its disposal – the common strategy. The Treaty of Amsterdam also provided for qualified majority voting under certain conditions and, since it was signed, the CFSP field has been developing in practice at every European Council. The Treaty of Nice (2001) introduced the possibility, under certain conditions, of establishing closer cooperation in the CFSP field for the implementation of joint actions and common positions. This closer cooperation may not be used for matters with military or defence implications. The European Constitution, currently in the process of ratification, provides for the creation of the post of Foreign Affairs Minister whose role will consist in conducting the CFSP. The Minister will be assisted by a newly-created European External Action Service. The Constitution also provides for the transfer of the power of initiative in this area from the Commission to the new Minister. Unanimity will remain the rule but the bridging mechanism may be used to switch to qualified majority voting in certain areas which have no military or defence implications. Once the Constitution has been ratified, the use of the legislative instruments under the CFSP will be excluded.

The objective of the CFP is to ensure that fishing and aquaculture activities contribute to long-term environmental, economic and social sustainability. This includes ensuring the traceability, security and quality of products marketed in the EU; contributing to increased productivity, to a fair standard of living for the fisheries sector, including small-scale fisheries, and to stable markets; and ensuring the availability of food supplies at reasonable prices for consumers. The scope of the CFP includes the conservation of marine biological resources and the management of the fisheries exploiting them. When it comes to market measures and financial measures, the CFP also covers fresh water biological resources and aquaculture activities, as well as the processing and marketing of fishery and aquaculture products. The most recent CFP reform dates back to 2013 and entered into force on 1 January 2014. The current CFP is based on four main pillars: 1.fisheries management 2.international policy 3.market and trade policy 4.funding of the policy. The fourth element of the CFP is the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (2021-2027), which helps to attain the CFP objectives through financing eligible actions. The CFP stipulates that catch limits should be set that are sustainable and maintain fish stocks in the long term. The CFP adopts a cautious approach which recognises the impact of human activity on all components of the ecosystem. It seeks to make fishing fleets more selective in what they catch, and to phase out the practice of discarding by avoiding and reducing — as far as possible — unwanted catches, ensuring that catches are landed. The CFP has changed the way in which fisheries policies are managed, giving regional groups of Member States greater control through the introduction of so-called regionalisation. The CFP is enshrined in Articles 38-43 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). According to Article 3 TFEU, the conservation of marine biological resources under the CFP is an 'exclusive competence' of the EU, meaning that the EU alone is able to legislate and adopt binding acts. Member States can only do so if empowered by the EU to implement such acts. According to Article 4 TFEU, those parts of the CFP which deal with aspects other than the conservation of marine biological resources fall under 'shared competence', meaning that the EU and its Member States are able to legislate and adopt legally binding acts and Member States can exercise their own competence where the EU does not exercise, or has decided not to exercise, its own competence.

It seeks to: preserve peace; reinforce international security; and promote international cooperation, democracy, the rule of law and the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. The EU has a diplomatic service, the European External Action Service (EEAS), which was formally launched in 2011. The EEAS acts under the authority of the EU's High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the Commission (HR/VP), a position currently held by Josep Borrell Fontelles. It assists the HR/VP in fulfilling their mandate (as representative of the CFSP and as chairperson of the Foreign Affairs Council, as well as in their role of Vice-President of the Commission, which constitutes fulfilling the responsibilities incumbent on the Commission in external relations). The Political and Security Committee (PSC), comprising ambassadors from the 27 EU countries, also acts under the responsibility of the HR/VP. It monitors the international situation in the areas covered by the CFSP and plays a key role in defining and following up on the EU's response to a crisis. The CFSP was first established in 1993 under the Maastricht Treaty. It has been progressively reinforced by subsequent treaties, particularly the Treaty of Lisbon (Title V of the Treaty on European Union). Since the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force, in December 2009, the EU has legal personality (i.e. it is able to sign international treaties).

Until 2007, when a single CMO was created, there were 21 CMOs, each with its own rules. Article 40 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union underpins the establishment of CMOs. In 2013, the CAP was further reformed. The main purposes of the new CMO regulation are to provide a safety net to agricultural markets through the use of market-support tools, exceptional measures and aid schemes for certain sectors (in particular fruit and vegetables, and wine), to encourage producer cooperation through producer organisations and specific rules on competition and to lay down marketing standards for certain products.

European competition policy is intended to ensure free and fair competition in the European Union. EU rules on competition (Articles 101 to 109 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - TFEU) are based on 5 main principles: prohibition of concerted practices and agreements and of abuse of a dominant position liable to affect competition within the common market (antitrust rules); preventive supervision of mergers with a European dimension (i.e. to ensure that the significant size of the proposed merged operation in the EU market would not result in restrict competition; supervision of aid granted by EU countries which threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods; liberalisation of sectors previously controlled by public monopolies, such as telecommunications, transport or energy; cooperation with competition authorities outside the EU.

Economic competitiveness has long been one of the key political priorities of the European Union (EU). To recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the EU has adopted NextGenerationEU – a EUR1.8 trillion (in 2018 prices) post-pandemic recovery plan, designed to build a greener, more digital and more resilient Europe – and its Recovery and Resilience Facility. In this context, the EU has accelerated its transition towards climate neutrality and digital leadership, transforming the economy, society and industry and requiring new technologies, investment and innovation to ensure the EU remains competitive, while allowing EU economies and societies to grow and to reduce poverty and inequality. In other words, to create an economy that works for people. This involves, among other things, a shift from linear production to a circular economy for products, services, markets and business models. Two of the European Commission's priorities that are of particular relevance to the EU's competitiveness are: the European Green Deal and a Europe fit for the digital age. The European Green Deal focuses on creating a resource-efficient and competitive economy. The communication was followed up by the climate law, and other measures, to make the EU's climate, energy, transport and taxation policies fit to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. The EU's digital transformation is mainly based on: the digital strategy (2020), for a fair and competitive digital economy; the 2030 digital compass (2021), designed to enable people and businesses to create a human-centred, sustainable and prosperous digital future; the proposed path to the digital decade (2021), addressing the gaps in digital capacities, focusing on digital skills, digital infrastructure, digital business and digital public services. The new industrial strategy for Europe, as updated in 2021, offers new measures to accelerate the green and digital transitions, and also responds to calls to identify and monitor the main indicators of economic competitiveness: internal market integration productivity growth international competitiveness public and private investment and research and development investment.

Title XVI of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU provides the legal basis for TENs. TENs projects are partly funded by the EU and partly by the EU countries involved. The facility was originally created for the 2014-2020 period to stimulate investment in the TENs and to leverage funding from both the private and public sectors. It has been extended for the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework period. The amounts allocated to the programme from the EU budget are as follows. Transport: EUR11.4 billion (plus a transfer of EUR10 billion from the Cohesion Fund), of which EUR1.4 billion is for the major missing cross-border railway links between cohesion countries. Energy: EUR5.2 billion. Digital: EUR1.8 billion. The CEF's specific objectives are as follows. Transport To develop projects of common interest relating to efficient, interconnected and multimodal networks and infrastructure for smart, interoperable, sustainable, inclusive, accessible, safe and secure mobility. To adapt parts of the trans-European transport network for a dual use of the transport infrastructure to improve both civilian and military mobility. Energy To develop projects of common interest in order to further integrate the EU's internal energy market and the interoperability of networks across borders and sectors, thus facilitating the decarbonisation of the economy, promoting energy efficiency and ensuring security of supply. To facilitate cross-border cooperation in the area of energy, including renewable energy. Digital To develop projects of common interest relating to the deployment of safe and secure very-high-capacity digital networks and 5G systems, to the increased resilience and capacity of digital backbone networks on EU territories by linking them to neighbouring territories, and to the digitalisation of the transport and energy networks.

In developing a competitive and agile European space and services industry, Copernicus aims to nurture innovative earth observation systems and services and ensure Europe's independent access to evidence-based knowledge about the environment and the climate, and to key observation and geo-information gathering technologies. The information services are fully, freely and openly accessible to its users. Copernicus comprises three aspects: a service component ensuring information in the areas of atmosphere monitoring, marine environment monitoring, land monitoring, climate change, emergency management and security; a space component ensuring sustainable spaceborne observations for the above service areas; and anin situ component ensuring coordinated access to observations through airborne, seaborne and ground-based installations for the above service areas — the in situ data are essential in ensuring the delivery of quality data and information. Copernicus core users can be policymakers and public authorities who can use the information as a basis for developing policies and legislation, such as in the environmental field or in the civil protection area in the event of a natural disaster or humanitarian crisis. Other users include commercial and private users, the education and research sectors, and not-for-profit organisations. Copernicus data and information are in general made available on a full, open and non-fee basis. This is to promote their use and sharing, as well as to boost European earth observation markets, in particular the development of applications and value-added services and products, for example, monitoring urban air quality.

Each EU Member State is represented in Coreper by a Permanent Representative (Coreper II) and a Deputy Permanent Representative (Coreper I) with the status of ambassador to the European Union. Coreper occupies a pivotal position in the EU's decision-making system. It coordinates and prepares the work of all meetings of the Council and attempts to find, at its level, an agreement which will be subsequently submitted for adoption by the Council. It also ensures consistency of the EU's policies and actions and sees to it that the following principles and rules are observed: the principles of legality, subsidiarity, proportionality and providing reasons for acts; rules setting out the powers of EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies; budgetary provisions; rules on procedure, transparency and the quality of drafting. It ensures adequate presentation of each file to the Council and, where appropriate, it presents guidelines, options or suggestions. The agendas for Council meetings reflect the progress made in Coreper. Coreper's agenda is divided into 2 parts: Part I includes items which do not in principle require discussion, and which will normally be 'A' items on the Council's agenda (i.e. items which, as prepared by Coreper, could be approved by the Council without discussion); Part II requires discussion. However, if Coreper reaches an agreement on a Part II item on its agenda, that item will normally be included as an 'A' item on the Council's agenda, which consists of: A items, to be approved without discussion following agreement within Coreper; B items, which require discussion. Coreper is divided into 2 parts: Coreper I prepares the work of 6 Council configurations: Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumers Affairs; Competitiveness (Internal Market, Industry, Research and Space); Transport, Telecommunications and Energy; Agriculture and Fisheries; Environment; Education, Youth, Culture and Sport. Coreper II prepares the work of 4 Council configurations: General Affairs; Foreign Affairs; Economic and Financial Affairs; Justice and Home Affairs. In principle, Coreper meets every week. Preparations for its work are made the day before by the closest collaborators of the members of Coreper who meet under the names: Mertens Group for Coreper Part 1; Antici Group for Coreper Part 2. These groups review the agenda for Coreper I and II, respectively, and settle technical and organisational details. This preparatory stage also makes it possible to form an initial idea of the positions which the various delegations will take at the Coreper meeting. Coreper may adopt procedural decisions listed in Article 19(7) of the Council's Rules of Procedure (for example, decision to hold a Council meeting in a place other than Brussels or Luxembourg, decision to use the written procedure).

The European Commission's 2011 CSR strategy urged companies to set up procedures to 'integrate social, environmental, ethical human rights and consumer concerns into their business operations and core strategy in close collaboration with their stakeholders'. Since then, the EU has demonstrated its commitment to CSR, the United Nations (UN) 2030 agenda for sustainable development and UN's Sustainable Development Goals, including by: publishing documents such as its communication 'Next steps for a sustainable European future — European action for sustainability'; adopting legislation such as Directive 2014/95/EU on the disclosure of non-financial and diversity information by large companies and groups; supporting international initiatives such as the International Labour Organization's principles concerning multinational enterprises and social policy, and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's work on due diligence.

Its meetings are attended by ministers from the 27 EU Member States. It has policymaking and coordinating functions. The Council's seat is in Brussels, but, in accordance with the Protocol No 6 to the Treaties and its Rules of Procedure, its meetings are held in Luxembourg in April, in June and in October. Sessions of the Council (except for the Foreign Affairs Council) are convened and chaired by the six-monthly presidency. The Council meets in 10 configurations, bringing together the relevant ministers from the Member States: General Affairs; Foreign Affairs; Economic and Financial Affairs; Justice and Home Affairs; Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs; Competitiveness (Internal Market, Industry, Research and Space); Transport, Telecommunications and Energy; Agriculture and Fisheries; Environment; Education, Youth, Culture and Sport. The 'General Affairs' Council prepares and follows up the meetings of the European Council, together with the President of the European Council and the Commission (Article 16(6) first subparagraph of the Treaty on European Union). It is responsible for the overall coordination of policies, institutional and administrative questions and areas affecting more than one EU policy, such as the multiannual financial framework and enlargement. It also ensures consistency and continuity in the work of the different Council configurations. The work of the Council is prepared by the Committee of Permanent Representatives of the Member States (Coreper). To help in preparing the Council's work, Coreper may set up working parties or committees. Coreper is divided into 2 parts: Coreper II, composed of the permanent representatives of the governments of the Member States, deals with items relating to the General Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Economic and Financial Affairs and Justice and Home Affairs configurations of the Council; Coreper I, composed of the deputy permanent representatives, prepares all other Council configurations. The Council, together with the European Parliament, carries out legislative and budgetary functions. It is also the lead institution for decision-making on the common foreign and security policy (CFSP). Member States coordinate their economic policies within the Council. In most cases, the Council's decisions, based on proposals from the Commission, are taken jointly with the European Parliament under the ordinary legislative procedure. Depending on the subject, the Council takes decisions by simple majority, qualified majority or unanimity. The qualified majority is the voting rule by default. According to the Treaties, some decisions are adopted not by the Council but by common agreement of the governments of the Member States, for instance the appointments of the Judges and Advocates-General to the Court of Justice of the European Union, or the setting of the seats of the institutions and agencies. Those decisions are generally adopted on the sidelines of the Council or Coreper meetings. They are not EU acts and therefore cannot be challenged before the Court of Justice of the European Union.

There are no customs duties at the EU Customs Union's internal borders. All goods circulate freely within the customs union area, whether they are made in the EU or imported from outside. A new EU Customs Code which simplifies rules and procedures for customs and makes trading more efficient was adopted in 2013. Once it applies, in May 2016, it will greatly simplify and streamline EU customs procedures.

The countries within that union also agree not to apply customs duties between themselves. Essentially, once goods have passed customs they can move freely between those countries. The EU's Customs Union is a unique example. Within the EU's Customs Union, the 27 EU Member States apply a uniform system for handling the import, export and transit of goods and implement a common set of customs rules called the Union Customs Code (UCC). The Code entered into force on 1 May 2016, but some transitional arrangements still apply. A uniform system of customs duties applies on imports from outside the EU and there are no customs duties at the borders between Member States. The EU Customs Union is essential for the proper functioning of the single market. In practice, national customs authorities in all 27 Member States work together as one to manage the day-to-day operations of the Customs Union. The European Commission proposes EU customs legislation and monitors its implementation. In September 2020, the Commission launched a Customs Action Plan to take the EU Customs Union to the next level. The Action Plan put forward steps to make EU customs smarter, more innovative and more efficient, such as improved use of data, better tools and equipment, promoting compliance, more cooperation within the EU and with customs authorities of partner countries, and better preparation for future crises.

This is most recently reflected in its long-term budget (multiannual financial framework) for the 2021–2027 period, with significant funding earmarked to support cybersecurity research, innovation and infrastructure, cyberdefence and the cybersecurity industry. Since 2004, and strengthened by the 2019 EU Cybersecurity Act, the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) has been working with EU Member States and other relevant parties, delivering advice and solutions and building up their cybersecurity capabilities to jointly respond to large-scale cross-border cybersecurity incidents. The EU's latest cybersecurity strategy, presented in 2020, seeks to bolster its collective resilience against cyber threats and help ensure that citizens and businesses can benefit fully from trustworthy and reliable services and digital tools. It contains proposals for regulatory, investment and policy initiatives to be taken in three areas. Improving resilience, technological sovereignty and leadership. This will be achieved by reforming the rules on the security of network and information systems. This includes adopting revised legislation (a new directive, proposed in 2020) on measures for a high common level of cybersecurity across the EU to increase the cyber resilience of critical public and private sector infrastructures. Building operational capacity to prevent, deter and respond. A new Joint Cyber Unit is to be created to boost cooperation between EU bodies and Member State authorities responsible for preventing, deterring and responding to cyberattacks. The EU cyber diplomacy toolbox will be upgraded to prevent, discourage, deter and respond effectively to malicious cyber activities, especially those affecting its critical infrastructure, supply chains, democratic institutions and processes. Advancing a global and open cyberspace through increased cooperation. This will be achieved by working with international partners and organisations to strengthen the rules-based global order, promoting international security and stability in cyberspace and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms online. The EU will increase cyber capacity-building efforts in non-EU countries, along with cyber dialogues with non-EU countries, regional and international organisations and the multi-stakeholder community.

To harness the potential of data and to build a market for personal and non-personal data, the EU adopted the data governance act. The data governance act: creates a mechanism to enable the safe reuse of certain categories of public-sector data that are subject to the rights of others, for example, trade secrets, personal data and data protected by intellectual property rights (public-sector bodies allowing this type of reuse will need to be properly equipped, in technical terms, to ensure that privacy and confidentiality are fully preserved); enables the Commission to set up a European single access point with a searchable electronic register of public-sector data, available via national single information points; creates a framework for a new business model – data intermediation services – that will provide a secure environment in which companies or individuals can share data; makes it easier for individuals and companies to make data voluntarily available for the common good, such as medical research projects; introduces voluntary certification in the form of a logo to make it easier to identify compliant providers of data intermediation services and data altruism organisations; allows for a new structure, the European Data Innovation Board, to be created to advise and assist the Commission in improving the interoperability of data intermediation services and issuing guidelines on how to facilitate the development of data spaces, among other tasks; creates safeguards for public-sector data, data intermediation services and data altruism organisations against the unlawful international transfer of, or governmental access to, non-personal data (for personal data, the EU already has similar safeguards under the general data protection regulation).

The right to the protection of personal data is a fundamental right enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights . It belongs to the set of values protected under Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union and it contributes to the realisation of the EU's objectives under Article 3 of the treaty. Article 16 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union grants all individuals the right to the protection of their personal data. It also requires the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to lay down rules to protect individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies, and by the Member States when carrying out activities that fall within the scope of EU law. Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights requires that personal data be processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis of the consent of the person concerned or some other legitimate basis laid down by EU law. Each individual, furthermore, has the right of access to data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified. Compliance with these rules shall be subject to the control of an independent authority. Over the years, the EU has enacted several pieces of legislation to ensure the protection of personal data, including those listed below. Regulation (EU) 2016/679 on protecting individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of those data, known as the GDPR (general data protection regulation. Directive (EU) 2016/680 on protecting individuals when personal data are used by law enforcement authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties. Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 laying down rules for protecting individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of those data. Directive 2002/58/EC on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector.

The Commission's powers to adopt delegated acts are subject to strict conditions: the basic act must define the objectives, content, scope and duration of the delegation of power; the actual delegated act — adopted on the basis of this delegation — cannot change the essential elements of the basic act; delegated acts can only be of general application (i.e. cannot address individual situations). The Commission consults experts from the EU Member States before adopting delegated acts. Furthermore, either the European Parliament or the Council of the European Union may revoke the delegation of power to the Commission. In addition, a delegated act adopted by the Commission can only enter into force if no objection is raised by the Council or the Parliament, within the deadline set in the basic act, which is usually 2 months.

In the case of the European Union (EU), it refers to a perceived lack of accessibility or lack of representation of the ordinary citizen with respect to the EU institutions – a sense of there being a gap between the powers of those institutions and a perceived inability of citizens to influence those institutions' decisions. The issue of democratic legitimacy has been a sensitive one at each stage of the European integration process. It was addressed in the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice Treaties, which progressively gave more powers to the directly elected European Parliament and extended the areas in which it has joint decision-making powers with the Council of the European Union. As a result, the Parliament has evolved from a consultative assembly to a co-legislator. Several changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, which has applied since 1 December 2009, served to address concerns of a democratic deficit in the EU. The treaty strengthened the Parliament's powers in the following three areas. Financial. The Parliament plays a key role in approving all categories of EU annual budget expenditures. Legislative. The co-decision procedure became the ordinary legislative procedure and applies to almost all areas where the Council decides by qualified majority vote. Nomination. The Parliament elects the President of the European Commission on the basis of a candidate proposed by the European Council taking into account the results of the Parliament elections. The Commission as a body is subject to the consent of the Parliament before being appointed by the European Council. With the principle of subsidiarity in mind, the Treaty of Lisbon also introduced ways to encourage national parliaments to participate in EU policy formulation, giving them the opportunity to scrutinise the Commission's legislative proposals (known as the subsidiarity scrutiny mechanism). The Treaty of Lisbon also establishes a citizens' initiative right, where citizens can ask the Commission to propose legislation in any field in which it has the power to act. To launch a European citizens' initiative, a group of organisers must be set up, comprising at least seven EU citizens from seven different EU Member States. Once an initiative has reached 1 million signatures and the prescribed minimum thresholds in seven Member States, the Commission will decide what action to take. The institutions' decision-making processes are sometimes criticised for their lack of transparency, in particular in the context of trilogues between the Council, the Commission and the Parliament. Today, the institutions publish the final compromise text that is adopted as a result of interinstitutional negotiations. In addition, the formal rules of procedure relating to the negotiation process have been improved. Members of the Council meet in public sessions when discussing or voting on proposals for legislative acts. The first deliberation on important non-legislative proposals is also public and the Council also regularly holds public debates on key issues affecting the interests of the EU and its citizens. The Conference on the Future of Europe, which formally concluded on 9 May 2022 (Europe Day), was a bottom-up, grassroots exercise, which has allowed citizens to have a say on what they expect from the EU and have a greater role in shaping its future. The conference was a joint undertaking of the Parliament, the Council and the Commission, acting as equal partners together with the Member States. A key component of the conference was the creation of citizen panels at the EU level and in several Member States, which held debates and events designed to feed into the conference plenary with recommendations for the EU institutions. The conference results are presented in a report which puts forward 49 proposals on the future of Europe, covering several topics including European democracy. The EU institutions provided their feedback regarding these proposals at a feedback event in autumn 2022.

The rules and details of the programme are set out in Regulation (EU) 2021/694. An indicative allocation of more than EUR7.5 billion at 2021 prices has been allocated to the programme, which is implemented mainly under direct management by the European Commission. The programme involves co-financing from Member States and, when needed, from the private sector. Grants under the programme may cover up to 100% of the eligible costs. There are five specific objectives which are intended to enhance Europe's capacities in key digital technology areas in the private sector and in areas of public interest: high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity and trust, advanced digital skills, and deployment and best use of digital capacity and interoperability.

It covers a wide range of products, applications, processes and business models that are transforming financial services and that may benefit businesses and consumers by: allowing them greater access to financial services; offering wider choice; and making operations more efficient. These technologies can also help to bring down national barriers and boost competition in areas such as: online banking, online payments and transfer services; peer-to-peer lending; personal investment advice and services. In 2020, the European Commission adopted a digital finance package. This includes the Commission's strategy for harnessing the potential of digital finance while addressing potential challenges. The package also included two sets of legislative proposals on crypto-assets and digital resilience. The strategy aims to give consumers access to innovative financial products, while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability. It has 4 priorities: removing fragmentation in the EU's digital single market; adapting the regulatory framework to facilitate digital innovation; promoting data-driven finance; tackling the challenges and risks of digital transformation, including enhancing the digital operational resilience of the financial system. The legislative proposals concern the creation of: a framework on crypto-assets to allow for innovation in a way that preserves financial stability and protects investors; a framework on digital operational resilience to prevent and mitigate cyber threats, ensuring banks, stock exchanges, clearing houses and FinTech organisations, meet strict standards to prevent and limit the impact of technology-related incidents. The Commission also adopted a strategy on retail payments in 2020. This aims to further develop the European payments market so it can benefit fully from innovation and the opportunities that come with digitalisation.

These wallets could be provided by public authorities or by private entities, on condition that they are recognised by an EU Member State. The digital identity would allow users to access services online without having to use private identification methods or unnecessarily sharing personal data, thus giving them full control of the data they share. They would be able to prove their identity and to share electronic documents from their digital wallets with a click on their smartphone or a similar device. Several Member States have already developed national digital identities. In June 2021, the Commission issued a proposal to amend the existing EU legislation on the electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market (the eIDAS regulation). This amendment, when adopted, would allow the European digital identity wallets to build on these national systems and for these systems to become interoperable.

At EU level, the European Commission is taking action to help public administrations across the Member States to make the change to digital so that all citizens can enjoy the benefits of smart public services. Its focus is on reducing barriers to public services and ensuring they are accessible across borders. Actions already under way include: ensuring EU platforms can work together and interact with one another; funding large-scale e-participation projects; encouraging public services, businesses and citizens to share solutions through the Joinup platform, a common venue that enables IT solutions and good practices to be shared and reused, and facilitates communication and collaboration on IT projects across the EU; standardising electronic health records.

Generally, this needs to be done within 2 years of the directive's adoption. To take effect, national measures must achieve the objectives set by the directive. National authorities must communicate the measures they adopt to the European Commission.

Alongside the principles of subsidiarity (where the EU may act only if – and in so far as – the objective of a proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, but could be better achieved at the EU level) and of proportionality (where the content and scope of EU action may not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the treaties), is the principle of conferral (Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union). The principle of conferral means that the EU can only act within the limits of the competences that have been conferred upon it by the EU treaties. The division of competences is set out in Article 2 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and further specified in Articles 3–6. There are three types of competences. Exclusive (Article 3 TFEU). Only the EU can act in these areas, for example the customs union and trade policy. Shared between the EU and EU Member States (Article 4 TFEU). Member States can act only if the EU has chosen not to, for example in the transport, cohesion policy, energy and environment areas. Member States may ask the European Commission to repeal an adopted legislative act in one of the shared areas, so as to ensure better compliance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality (Declaration No 18 annexed to the Treaty of Lisbon). The EU can support, coordinate or supplement Member States' actions (Article 6 TFEU), for example in the culture and tourism areas. In these areas, the EU may not adopt legally binding acts that require the Member States to harmonise their laws and regulations. The EU can take measures to ensure that Member States coordinate their economic, social and employment policies at the EU level (Article 5 TFEU). The EU's common foreign and security policy is characterised by specific institutional features. The policy is defined and implemented by the European Council and by the Council of the European Union, with only limited roles for the European Parliament and the Commission.

Economic integration brings the benefits of greater size, internal efficiency and robustness to the EU economy as a whole and to the economies of individual EU countries. This, in turn, offers opportunities for economic stability, higher growth and more employment — outcomes of direct benefit to EU citizens. In practical terms, EMU means: coordination of economic policymaking between EU countries; coordination of fiscal policies, particularly limits on government debt and deficit; an independent monetary policy run by the European Central Bank (ECB) in the euro area; single rules and supervision of financial institutions within the euro area; the single currency and the euro area. Since the 2008 financial and economic crisis, the EU has greatly strengthened its economic governance systems to better detect, prevent, and correct potential economic problems such as excessive government deficits, public debt levels or macroeconomic imbalances, and to make sure that Europe is better prepared for future economic shocks.

The EU's economic governance framework revolves around the European semester and its economic policy coordination system. The European semester allows EU countries to discuss their economic and budget plans and monitor progress at specific times throughout the year. It seeks to ensure that: there are clear rules; national policies are better coordinated year-round; there is regular monitoring; the emergence of potentially harmful macroeconomic imbalances can be identified early on; and sanctions are enforced when countries fail to comply with the rules. Following the economic and financial crisis of 2008-2010, the EU beefed up its economic governance rules to reinforce its Stability and Growth Pact with: the six-pack laws (a system to monitor broader economic policies so as to detect problems like property bubbles or falling competitiveness at an early stage — macroeconomic imbalance procedure); the two-pack laws (euro-area countries — other than those with macroeconomic adjustment programmes — must submit their draft budget plans by 15 October each year and the European Commission issues an opinion by the end of November); the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (fiscal compact). The Commission has also started to integrate the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) into the European semester as part of its strategy to put sustainable development at the heart of economic policy. In early 2020, the Commission presented a review of the effectiveness of EU economic governance and launched a debate on its future in view of the EU's evolving priorities. The review examines how effective the economic surveillance framework has been in achieving three key objectives: ensuring sustainable government finances and economic growth, as well as avoiding macroeconomic imbalances; enabling closer coordination of economic policies; and promoting convergence in EU countries' economic performance.

These include monetary policy (money supply and demand), taxation, budget, job creation, etc. In the European Union (EU), although economic policy is the responsibility of each EU country, there is considerable multilateral coordination of economic policies between the individual countries, particularly those which belong to the euro area, to ensure that European monetary union operates in the best way possible, and to ensure the alignment of EU countries with common aims and responsibilities. Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union sets out the EU's aims, which include balanced economic growth, price stability, and economic and monetary union. Article 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) gives the EU exclusive responsibility for monetary policy for EU countries which belong to the euro area. Article 5 TFEU sets out that economic policies should be coordinated within the Union. Title VIII TFEU deals with economic and monetary policy. It defines how economic policy coordination takes place and requires EU countries to carry out their national economic policies 'with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Union'. Economic policy coordination includes: adopting broad economic policy guidelines and employment guidelines, monitoring economic developments to identify and correct risky or unsustainable policies, and macroeconomic discussions between the Council, the European Central Bank, the European Commission and social partners. The Stability and Growth Pact sets out rules to ensure that EU countries aim towards sound public finances and coordinate their fiscal policies. Since 2008, in view of the difficulties the EU (particularly the euro area) had in dealing with the economic, financial and sovereign debt crisis, several reforms have been made: 1.The Stability and Growth Pact was strengthened by the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance, which came into force in 2013. The 6 laws ('6-pack') which reinforce the Stability and Growth Pact and macroeconomic oversight of EU countries were adopted, as were 2 further laws ('2-pack') that provide for additional coordination and monitoring in the euro area. 2.The European semester, an annual policy coordination framework, was created. This aims to identify and correct macroeconomic imbalances between EU countries, and to supervise budget policy. The Commission also analyses each EU country's structural reform policies, and then issues country-specific recommendations for action. 3.The creation of an integrated banking union which aims to align responsibility for supervision, resolution and funding at EU level and to ensure that euro area banks all comply with the same rules. Banks and their shareholders are liable for possible losses, not taxpayers.

The European Commission's digital single market strategy, adopted in 2018, sets out a plan that puts citizens at the centre of the healthcare system by: enabling secure, cross-border access to citizens' electronic health records and the possibility of sharing their records between EU Member States; facilitating the use of larger data sets through a shared European data infrastructure to prevent diseases, determine personalised medical treatment and better anticipate epidemics; and providing digital tools that enable citizens to manage their health more actively within integrated care systems. This approach serves as the basis for EU action in digital health, which includes support for the exchange of e-prescriptions and electronic patient summaries, enabling the cross-border exchange of full electronic health records, voluntary coordination in sharing data and resources for disease prevention and research, capacity building and the exchange of innovation and best practices for healthcare authorities.

Where an EU Member State fails to comply with EU law, the Commission may send it a 'letter of formal notice', which allows the Member State to submit its observations. If the Commission still believes that the violation of EU rules persists, it sends a reasoned opinion to the Member State. That reasoned opinion sets a deadline within which the Member State must comply with EU law. If the Member State does not comply within the deadline set, the Commission may bring the case before the Court of Justice of the European Union (under Article 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)). The Court may impose a financial penalty on a Member State which fails to observe the judgment after a second Court procedure (Article 260(2) TFEU). However, where the Member State has failed to implement a directive, the Court may impose financial sanctions when passing its first judgment, under Article 258 TFEU (Article 260(3) TFEU).

Article 8 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) empowers the EU to introduce measures eliminating inequalities and urges it to promote equality between men and women through all its policies. Article 153 TFEU underpins EU action in the area of equal opportunities and equal treatment in matters of employment and occupation and Article 157 TFEU recognises the principle that men and women should get equal pay for equal work or work of equal value. Article 19 TFEU grants the EU the competence to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. The EU has adopted several directives implementing the principle of equal treatment between men and women and between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin, sexual orientation, age and disability in different areas of life. Directive 79/7/EEC on the progressive implementation of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security.

Other EU rules such as those on competition, State aid and public service obligations also have an important impact on the sector. A key aspect of EU action has been the creation of a single European market for audiovisual services. The 2010 audiovisual media services directive provides a framework to promote the free movement, production and distribution of European television programmes and video-on-demand (VOD) services. The 2018 revision of the directive enhanced the level-playing field for broadcasters, VOD providers and video-sharing platforms, and strengthened the promotion of cultural diversity. In 2020, the European Commission adopted an action plan to support the recovery and transformation of the media and audiovisual sector.

The current MFF runs from 2021 to 2027. The EU budget is funded from several sources of revenue, known as the EU's 'own resources' (customs duties, a proportion of each EU country's gross national income, a share of EU countries' value added tax receipts and, as of 1 January 2021, a new own resource based on the amount of non-recycled plastic packaging waste). Every 7 years, the European Parliament and the Council negotiate the MFF and how the money will be allocated across spending areas on the basis of a proposal from the Commission. Every year, the European Parliament and the Council agree on the size of the annual budget and on the spending priorities for the next 12 months. To finance the post-coronavirus recovery, the EU agreed on a recovery plan, NextGenerationEU, worth EUR750 billion, to come on top of the 2021-2027 long-term budget.

EU copyright law consists of a range of directives and regulations harmonising essential rights, guaranteeing the protection needed to encourage creativity and stimulate investment in the sector. The aim is to promote cultural diversity and better access for consumers and businesses to digital content and services across Europe. Copyrighting uses licensing as its main mechanism, most often granted directly by the rights-holder or a rights management organisation. EU actions have led to more harmonised protection of rights-holders, lower costs and greater choice for content users, notably through: a European regulatory framework for copyright and related rights; promoting dialogues on copyright and related issues; and taking a leading role in international negotiations and discussions on copyright.

The EU seeks to bring its common cultural heritage to the fore by 'drawing inspiration from the cultural, religious and humanist inheritance of Europe', 'respecting its rich cultural and linguistic diversity', and 'ensuring that Europe's cultural heritage is safeguarded and enhanced'. While individual Member States are responsible for their own cultural policies, the role of the EU is to help tackle common challenges, ranging from the impact of digital technologies and the need to ensure fair remuneration for artists on digital platforms, to the need to support innovation in the cultural and creative sectors. The EU can also help these sectors recover in an event of a crisis, and foster their resilience to make them more sustainable in the future. The EU also supports actions to preserve cultural heritage, and promote cooperation and transnational exchanges between cultural institutions in the Member States. The new funding programme, Creative Europe 2021-2027, is the only EU programme specifically designed to provide support , cross-border cooperation and networking activities for all cultural and creative sectors. These sectors can also benefit from a range of specific opportunities under other EU funding streams including, for instance, Horizon Europe, the Single Market programme, the Recovery and Resilience Facility, or cohesion policy funds. Other initiatives include: European Capitals of Culture, launched in 1985; EU prizes for cultural sectors, such as the Music Moves Europe Talent Award, the EU Prize for Contemporary Architecture and the EU Prize for Literature; European Heritage Days, an initiative supported jointly with the Council of Europe which gives citizens access to sites that are normally not open to the public.

EU defence industrial initiatives in this area have as their legal basis Article 173 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which underpins industrial policy. Although several EU Member States have large, technologically sophisticated defence industries which have played an important role in their national economies, defence has been considered a sensitive area in which countries have been anxious to retain their sovereignty. Article 346 TFEU allowed them considerable latitude in the tendering of defence contracts (as did its predecessor, the Treaty of Rome), resulting in a fragmented market. Building on previous initiatives, in 2013 the European Commission adopted a strategy to boost the efficiency and competitiveness of the European defence technological and industrial base. To ensure more efficient defence spending, the strategy highlighted the importance of: boosting competitiveness via EU standards and certification, and better access to raw materials and funding for small and medium-sized defence companies; civil-military cooperation, exploiting the dual-use potential of EU-funded research (which had been civil oriented to this point). EU defence industry policy received further impetus with the European defence action plan (2016) and a communication on Launching the European Defence Fund to support collaborative defence research and development (2017). The European defence action plan has three strands: establishing the European Defence Fund, covering research and development of defence technologies and products; promoting investment in defence supply chains; strengthening the EU's internal market to tackle fragmentation and improve competitiveness by better implementing the rules on procurement and the transfer of defence-related products within the EU. Preceded by two pilot programmes, the European Defence Fund will have a budget of around EUR8 billion over the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework period. It will finance projects in which at least three entities (mainly companies and research organisations) from three different Member States jointly perform defence research and development activities, and will promote cross-border activities of small and medium-sized enterprises.

The legal bases for EU action are Article 83(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) on police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, and Article 168 TFEU, which stipulates that the EU should complement Member States' actions in reducing drug-related health damage, including by information and prevention measures. The EU is taking strategic and operational measures to reduce drug supply and demand and works closely with all partners at the national and international levels, EU institutions, bodies and agencies (such as the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction and the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol)), as well as civil-society organisations. A component of the EU's security union strategy, the EU drugs strategy 2021-2025, was adopted in December 2020. This seeks to: protect and improve the well-being of society and of the individual; protect and promote public health; offer a high level of security and well-being for the general public; increase health literacy. EU legislation on drug-related issues concerns, in particular, drug trafficking and new drugs. It defines drug trafficking offences and sets minimum rules on sanctions. The EU has also set up a system to exchange information on new drugs, assess their risks and subject to control any new drugs that are harmful.

The system is based on the ' cap and trade ' principle. This means that a 'cap', or limit, is set on the total amount of certain GHGs that can be emitted by the installations covered by the system. The cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. Within the cap, installations buy or receive emission allowances, which they can trade with one another as needed. The limit on the total number of allowances available ensures that they have a value. At the end of each year, an installation must give up enough allowances to cover all of its emissions. If an installation reduces its emissions, it can keep the allowances it has not used to cover its future needs or sell them on to another installation that is short of allowances. The ETS: operates in the EU Member States, plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. As of 1 January 2020, the EU ETS is also linked to the Swiss GHG emission trading system. From 2021, the EU ETS will cover electricity-generating installations in Northern Ireland; regulates emissions from nearly 11,000 power plants and manufacturing installations and around 600 aircraft operators flying to and from European Economic Area airports; covers around 38% of the EU's GHG emissions. In September 2020, under the European Green Deal, the European Commission presented a Climate Target Plan, an impact-assessed plan to reduce EU's net GHG emissions by at least 55% by 2030. In July 2021, the Commission presented legislative proposals to implement the new target, including revising and possibly expanding the scope of the EU ETS.

It also focuses on the careful and rational use of natural resources and contributes to promoting, at the international level, measures intended to combat regional or global environmental problems such as climate change and biodiversity loss. It is based on precautionary and preventive action, correction at source and the polluter-pays principle. Action in areas of environmental policy such as air and water pollution, nature protection and restoration, waste management and climate change is under the jurisdiction of the EU. The principle of subsidiarity, however, limits the scope of EU action with regard to tax-related matters, spatial planning and land use, along with quantitative water resource management. The EU's environmental policies are designed to speed up the transition to a sustainable, innovative and circular economy, where biodiversity is protected, valued and restored and environment-related health risks are minimised. They aim to enhance the EU's resilience and to decouple growth from resource use. In December 2019, the European Commission adopted the European Green Deal, its roadmap to address climate change and environmental degradation.

At the top of the hierarchy of EU norms is primary law, which consists of: the EU's constituent treaties (the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)) and its protocols; the Charter of Fundamental Rights (Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union); and the general principles established by the Court of Justice of the European Union.

To address the challenges posed by crime, the EU has introduced laws that aim to safeguard the rights of victims, suspects and prisoners cross-border cases (such as on mutual legal assistance, the mutual recognition of decisions in criminal cases and the European arrest warrant). In both criminal and civil law, measures have been adopted to: simplify procedures enabling national courts to cooperate with their equivalents in other Member States; train professionals involved in cross-border cases; develop information and communication technologies (such as videoconferencing) in the EU's justice system (e-Justice).

Space technology, data and services have become indispensable to the lives of EU citizens. The EU space policy addresses many of the EU's political priorities, such as: delivering the European Green Deal; making Europe fit for the digital age; supporting the European way of life; building a stronger Europe in the world. The EU space policy encompasses the EU space programme and synergies with the EU space research and innovation initiatives (Horizon EU), such as competitiveness for space systems and access to space. The latter initiative is based on the strategic research and innovation agenda for EU-funded space research supporting competitiveness and InvestEU. The EU space policy will promote the emergence of an EU new space ecosystem to foster entrepreneurship and to promote the EU space industry (see the Cassini space entrepreneurship initiative and the action plan on synergies between civil, defence and space industries). The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) defines the EU's role in space policy under Article 4 and Article 189. In particular, the TFEU gives the EU the powers to draw up an EU space policy and develop measures to implement it in the form of an EU space programme. The Multiannual Financial Framework 2021–2027 includes the regulation establishing the EU space programme and the EU Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) and allocates EUR14.88 billion for its implementation.

The main focus of EU tax policy is the smooth operation of its single market, i.e. ensuring that cross-border economic activity is not impeded by tax barriers and that distortions of competition are avoided. It seeks to ensure that citizens and businesses do not experience difficulties in regard to double taxation, distortion of competition, claiming tax refunds and obtaining information on tax rules in relation to other Member States. EU harmonisation efforts have predominantly concentrated on legislation on taxes levied on goods and services (indirect taxes, such as value added tax (VAT) and excise duties levied on energy products, electricity, alcohol and manufactured tobacco) rather than taxes on incomes or profits (direct taxes). Nevertheless, some progress has been made on measures to deal with tax evasion on savings and mutual assistance between tax administrations. Specific rules regarding taxation are laid down in Articles 110 to 113 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. Adopting harmonised legislation on taxation requires the unanimous agreement of all Member States in the Council, which has tended to act as a brake on the adoption of common rules. As a result, recently, a group of 11 Member States has been authorised to establish enhanced cooperation among themselves in the area of financial transaction tax and more use is now being made of non-binding approaches, such as recommendations, as a means of achieving coordination in the tax field.

The euro was introduced in phases.

According to the EU treaties, all Member States (with the exception of Denmark, which has an opt-out) are required to adopt the euro once they fulfil the convergence criteria (simply put, when their rate of inflation, their public finances, their exchange rate and their long-term interest rates broadly converge with those of the three best-performing euro-area countries).

The 2030 digital decade targets concern four key areas: a digitally skilled population and highly skilled digital professionals; secure and efficient sustainable digital infrastructures; digital transformation of businesses; and digitalisation of public services. The policy programme aims to set up a governance framework to help achieve the 2030 targets. The framework will be based on projected trajectories and annual cooperation between the Commission and (EU) Member States to stay on track and report on their progress. To address the gaps in the EU's critical capacities, multi-country projects are to be launched. These will combine investments from the EU budget, Member States and industry, building on the Recovery and Resilience Facility and other EU funding.

Together, the Member States and the Commission want to bring about a significant shift in education and training in Europe, ensuring that everybody has access to quality education along the following overarching priority areas. Improving the quality of education and training through a variety of actions including: boosting basic and transversal skills; promoting multilingualism and supporting language teaching and learning; developing a European perspective in education. Ensuring inclusion and gender equality to reduce inequalities by: tackling underachievement and early school leaving across the EU and decoupling educational attainment from socioeconomic background; promoting the inclusiveness, quality and recognition of cross-border volunteering and solidarity activities; promoting equal opportunities, access, inclusion, diversity and fairness across all actions under the Erasmus+ and European Solidarity Corps programmes; creating centres of excellence for vocational education and training; applying gender-sensitive and inclusive teaching. Promoting policies and investments to bring about the green and digital transitions through a series of actions including: creating an Education for Climate Coalition (a participatory education community to support the changes needed for a climate-neutral society); the greening of education infrastructure; proposing a Council recommendation on education for environmental sustainability; implementing the digital education action plan; making the Erasmus+ and European Solidarity Corps programmes greener and more digital. Enhancing competence and motivation in the education profession by: creating Erasmus Teacher Academies; providing European guidance for national career frameworks; conferring the European Innovative Teaching Award. Reinforcing higher education institutions by: proposing a European strategy for universities to promote the transformation of the higher education sector; ensuring a full roll-out of the European universities initiative; developing a European degree; establishing a legal statute for alliances of universities; implementing the European graduate tracking initiative; launching a European student card initiative and the Erasmus+ mobile app. Promoting lifelong learning and mobility by: improving mobility and cooperation opportunities; ensuring the automatic mutual recognition of higher education and upper secondary education and training qualifications and outcomes of learning periods abroad; agreeing on a European approach to microcredentials (qualifications that demonstrate learning outcomes acquired via short, transparently-assessed courses or modules). Achieving a geopolitical dimension — education as part of a stronger Europe in the world — by: using the 'Team Europe' approach (where the EU institutions and the Member States work together to support transformational change by delivering concrete results for partner countries); supporting the association of the western Balkans and strengthening cooperation with strategic global partners; expanding the international dimension of Erasmus+. NextGenerationEU and the multiannual financial framework (2021–2027) will channel more funds than ever before into education and training to support the EEA. Erasmus+ remains the EU's flagship programme when it comes to investing in education and training, but resources will also be available under other funds, such as the Recovery and Resilience Facility, the European Structural Funds or InvestEU. By implementing wide-ranging actions, the EEA will become a reality by 2025, and lead to the extensive modernisation of the education and training sector to the benefit of all European citizens.

In 2005, it was re-launched as part of the Lisbon Strategy. This led to a fusion of the European Employment Guidelines with the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (BEPG) into a single set of Integrated Guidelines for Growth and Jobs. The Lisbon Strategy was revised in 2010 with the launch of the Europe 2020 Strategy. EU countries agreed on new priorities, which were expressed in new targets and integrated guidelines. Since 2011, the EES is fully integrated in the European Semester, the yearly cycle of economic policy coordination. The EES is based on: the Joint Employment Report, which analyses the main employment challenges facing EU countries and their policy responses to the Employment Guidelines over the past year; the Annual Growth Survey, which sets out the EU's macroeconomic priorities to boost economic growth and job creation and opens the European semester; the Integrated Guidelines, which set the main policy priorities as regards employment and social matters; the Country-Specific Recommendations, which offer tailored guidance to EU countries on how to address the economic, employment and social challenges facing them.

They were joined in 1970 by Iceland, in 1986 by Finland and in 1991 by Liechtenstein. Meanwhile, in 1973, Denmark and the UK joined the EU; in 1986, Portugal joined the EU, and, in 1995, Austria, Finland and Sweden joined the EU, consequently leaving EFTA. EFTA currently has 4 member countries: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. The EFTA countries have developed one of the largest networks of Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). These FTAs span over 60 countries and territories, including the EU. EFTA's highest governing body is the EFTA Council. It generally meets 8 times a year at ambassadorial level and twice a year at ministerial level. The headquarters of the EFTA Secretariat are located in Geneva, with offices in Brussels and Luxembourg. The Secretariat in Geneva assists the EFTA Council in the management of relations between the 4 EFTA States, and deals with the negotiation and operation of EFTA's FTAs and Joint Declarations on Cooperation with non-EU countries. The Secretariat in Brussels provides support for the management of the EEA Agreement, including the preparation of new legislation and assistance in providing input into EU decision making.

It aims to help workers and self-employed persons reintegrate into the job market after they have lost jobs as a result of a major restructuring event. Whereas, initially, the EGF specifically targeted workers who lost their jobs due to globalisation, its scope was later broadened to cover job displacements due to the global financial and economic crisis, or further global crises (such as the economic crisis following the COVID-19 pandemic). For the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework, its scope was broadened to cover any possible cause of a restructuring event. In order to underline that it is helping displaced workers, and not the dismissing enterprises, the name was changed to include 'for Displaced Workers'. As a general rule, EGF support is triggered if more than 200 jobs are lost — salaried or self-employed — over a 4-month period (for dismissals in the same enterprise, or dismissals in the same region), or over a 6-month period in an enterprise or for a group of businesses (particularly small and medium-sized enterprises) in the same sector and geographical area. For dismissals in an enterprise, this threshold may include suppliers and downstream producers. However, in small labour markets, applications that do not meet this threshold may be accepted if the redundancies have a serious impact on employment and the local, regional or national economy. The EGF co-funds (with the EU Member State in question) projects that help workers look for new jobs, retrain themselves or set up new businesses. Projects may also involve careers advice and coaching. The EGF does not co-fund social protection measures, like pensions or unemployment benefits, or help firms restructure. The fund is implemented under shared management. EGF projects are thus managed by Member States' national/regional authorities. They run for 2 years.

It also exercises a power of control over the EU's activities through written and oral questions put to the Commission and the Council. It sets up special committees and committees of inquiry, the remit of which is not necessarily confined to the activities of EU institutions but can extend to action taken by Member States in implementing EU policies. The Treaty of Lisbon strengthened the EP's role by placing it on an equal footing with the Council by: extending the ordinary legislative procedure to 40 new fields, including agriculture, energy security, immigration, justice and home affairs, health and structural funds; strengthening the EP's role in the adoption of the EU budget – the EP is responsible for the adoption of the entire budget together with the Council; enabling MEPs to give their consent on a wide range of international agreements negotiated by the EU, such as international trade agreements; introducing new rights to be informed on the activities of the European Council, the rotating Council presidency and the European External Action Service; giving the EP the right to propose changes to the treaty; extending the EP's power of scrutiny in electing the President of the European Commission and by approving Members of the Commission by a vote of consent. MEPs attend EP plenary sessions in Strasbourg and Brussels, and committee and political group meetings in Brussels. Article 223(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU requires the EP to adopt a statute for MEPs. This lays down rules governing the performance of the duties of MEPs. A code of conduct requires MEPs to act solely in the public interest and conduct their work with disinterest, integrity, openness, diligence, honesty, accountability and respect for the EP's reputation. Article 232 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU requires the EP to adopt rules of procedure – the EP's internal organisational and operational rules.

The social pillar – the purpose of which is to deliver improved living and working conditions in the European Union (EU) – sets out 20 key principles and rights. These principles and rights fall within three themes: equal opportunities and access to the labour market (e.g. skills, education and lifelong learning, equal opportunities, gender equality and active support to employment); fair working conditions (e.g. secure and adaptable employment, wages, information about employment conditions and protection in the event of dismissals, social dialogue and work–life balance); social protection and inclusion (e.g. childcare, minimum income, unemployment benefits, inclusion of people with disabilities, assistance for the homeless, access to essential services, health and long-term care). At the Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth in Gothenburg in November 2017, the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission demonstrated their joint commitment by adopting a common proclamation on the European Pillar of Social Rights. The social pillar serves as a reference framework to monitor the performance of EU Member States' employment and social policies by means of a social scoreboard, and incorporates a new approach to mainstream social priorities into all EU policies. In 2021, the Commission adopted the European Pillar of Social Rights action plan. The plan has the following three headline targets to be met by 2030: at least 78% of the population aged 20 to 64 should be in employment; at least 60% of all adults should be participating in training every year; and a reduction of at least 15 million in the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion. The plan also identifies a set of actions to be taken in the areas of more and better jobs, skills, equality, social protection and inclusion. In 2022, the EU adopted a directive on minimum wages, reflecting principle 6 of the social pillar, which is the right of EU workers to fair wages that provide for a decent standard of living. It also adopted the gender balance on boards directive, which incorporates among its principles equality of treatment and opportunities between women and men, including regarding participation in the labour market, terms and conditions of employment and career progression.

The ESFS's main task is to ensure there is consistent and appropriate financial supervision throughout the EU to promote financial stability and to protect consumers of financial services products. The ESFS includes authorities responsible for micro-prudential supervision (focused on the stability of individual financial institutions) and macro-prudential supervision (focused on the stability of the financial system as a whole). The ESFS was set up in 2010 in response to the global financial crisis and came into operation in 2011. Its legal basis is Article 127(6) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which allows the Council to confer specific tasks on the European Central Bank (ECB) concerning policies relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and certain other financial institutions. As the European banking supervisor, the ECB works closely with the ESAs, and also provides the ESFS with a secretariat.

It involves software that uses machine learning, and other tools, to process information from large amounts of data using sensors, digital data or other inputs to generate behaviour based on models built using those data. This software allows machines to take decisions that would normally be taken by humans. In response to the European Union (EU) leaders' call for an EU approach to AI, the European Commission, in 2018, put forward an approach to make the most out of the opportunities offered by AI, while addressing the new challenges it brings. This EU-wide approach had three aims: to increase public and private investment in AI; to prepare for socio-economic changes; and to ensure an appropriate ethical and legal framework. This was followed, in 2021, by a more comprehensive package on AI involving: a communication on fostering an EU approach to AI; a coordinated plan with EU Member States to boost excellence in AI by joining forces on AI policy and investment; and a proposal for a regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence, addressing the risks of specific uses of AI and categorising them into four different levels: unacceptable risk, high risk, limited risk and minimal risk. Further legislative proposals are planned. These will seek to revise some of the EU's sectoral safety legislation (e.g. on machinery and on general product safety) and address liability issues related to new technologies. By means of the Digital Europe and Horizon Europe programmes, the Commission plans to invest EUR1 billion per year in AI. It will mobilise additional investments from the private sector and the Member States in order to reach an annual investment volume of EUR20 billion over the course of the next decade.

Article 173 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides the legal basis for the EU's industrial policy, which is a cross-cutting policy area with close links to other policy areas, such as the internal market, trade, competition, research and innovation, employment, digitalisation and environment-related policies. In accordance with a system of open and competitive markets, the policy aims to: speed up the adjustment of industry to structural changes; encourage an environment favourable to initiative and to developing businesses throughout the EU, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); encourage an environment favourable to cooperation between businesses; and foster better use of the industrial potential of policies of innovation, research and technological development. In March 2020, the European Commission presented a new industrial strategy for Europe as part of a package of initiatives for making Europe's businesses future-ready, which also includes a new SME strategy, steps to address barriers to the single market and better implement and enforce single market rules. The new industrial strategy will support the green and digital transitions of EU industry, make EU industry more competitive globally and enhance the EU's open strategic autonomy. To achieve this, it defines seven fundamental enabling factors, such as a deeper and more digital single market, upholding a global level playing field, working towards climate neutrality and a more a circular economy, and fostering innovation, skills and investments. The strategy proposes a partnership approach to governance around the concept of industrial ecosystems, incorporating all players operating in a value chain, and promotes the creation of joint initiatives bringing together investors, governmental, institutional and industrial partners in key technologies and business areas, such as industrial alliances. The strategy was updated in May 2021 to ensure that its industrial ambition takes full account of the new circumstances following the COVID-19 pandemic. It draws on the lessons learnt from the health crisis, such as the need to uphold the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital in the internal market and the need to work together to strengthen its resilience to disruptions. The updated strategy lays out the main policy priorities under three main strands: strengthening the resilience of the single market; dealing with the EU's strategic dependencies and strengthening the EU's open strategic autonomy to avoid over-dependency on non-EU countries for supply of critical goods; accelerating the green and digital transitions. The updated strategy is accompanied by the first Annual Single Market Report, including an analysis of the state of play of the EU economy based on an assessment of industrial ecosystems, a report on the progress made in delivering the March 2020 industrial package (including the single market enforcement action plan, the new industrial strategy and the SME strategy) and a set of key performance indicators to monitor further progress, together with a first analysis on the EU's strategic dependencies and capacities. On 23 February 2022, the Commission published the Annual Single Market Report 2022 and the second edition of in-depth reviews of the EU's strategic dependencies.

The European Commission can launch an EDP against an EU country not respecting the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), a body of rules governing the coordination of EU countries' fiscal policies. In particular, the EDP can be launched if an EU country: having breached or being in risk of breaching the deficit threshold of 3% of GDP; or having violated the debt rule by having a government debt level above 60% of GDP, which is not diminishing at a satisfactory pace — this means that the gap between a country's debt level and the 60% reference needs to be reduced by one 20th annually (on average over 3 years). The SGP aims to safeguard sound public finances and has two arms: a preventive arm, which ensures EU countries' fiscal policy is conducted in a sustainable manner; a corrective arm, which lays down how countries should take action in the event their public debt or budget deficit is considered excessive. The EDP is governed by Article 126 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and underpins the corrective arm of the EU's SGP. Every April, euro-area countries submit stability programmes to the Commission and to the Council, while non-euro-area countries submit convergence programmes to the same institutions. A stability or convergence programme must include the country's medium-term budgetary objective as well as information as to how this will be achieved. It also contains an analysis of the effects of changes in the main underlying economic assumptions on the country's fiscal position. The programmes are examined by the Commission. If the criteria are not met, an EDP is launched by the Council based on recommendations by the Commission. The EDP requires the country in question to provide a plan of the corrective action and policies it will follow, as well as deadlines for their achievement. Euro-area countries that do not follow up on the recommendations may be fined.

The MIP is a key element in the EU's reformed economic governance framework brought into being following the 2008 financial crisis. The procedure is designed to: identify potential risks at an early stage (an alert mechanism), prevent the emergence of harmful macroeconomic imbalances, and correct any imbalances that are already in place. If the alert mechanism identifies concerns over a country's macroeconomic imbalances, the European Commission and the Council can adopt preventive country-specific recommendations. In more serious cases, the excessive imbalance procedure may be triggered. The country which is found to experience excessive imbalances has to submit an action plan with clear milestones and deadlines for implementing corrective action in line with the recommendations. The Commission closely monitors its progress.Sanctions of up to 0.1 % of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) may be imposed by the Council, in the event that a euro area country repeatedly fails to take the agreed measures or if its corrective action plan is insufficient.

The European Anti-fraud Office (OLAF) was set up in 1999 under Decision 1999/352/EC, ECSC, Euratom and its powers and competences are defined by Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013. OLAF's main objectives are: to protect the financial interests of the EU by investigating fraud, corruption and any other illegal activities; to detect and investigate serious misconduct by EU staff, which could result in disciplinary or criminal proceedings; to provide assistance to the European Public Prosecutor's Office; and to support the EU institutions and national governments in developing and implementing anti-fraud legislation and policies. In the exercise of its powers, OLAF conducts (administrative) external investigations in the EU Member States and internal investigations within the EU institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and recommends action (where necessary) to the EU institutions and national governments concerned. As a result of OLAF's investigative work, sums unduly spent are gradually returned to the EU budget, criminals face prosecution before national courts and better anti-fraud safeguards are put in place throughout Europe. On the basis of Part Three, Title V, Chapters 4 and 5 of the TFEU, which deal with police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, Eurojust and Europol have the power to support Member States in the fight against fraud and corruption by providing complementary support to national authorities during transnational criminal investigations. In 2017, under the enhanced cooperation procedure, 22 of the 27 Member States established an independent and decentralised prosecution office of the EU. Set up under Regulation (EU) 2017/1939, the European Public Prosecutor's Office has the competence to investigate, prosecute and bring to judgment crimes against the EU's financial interests. Since 2019, common EU rules introduced by Directive (EU) 2017/1371 came into force to fight crime affecting the EU budget and to better protect the EU's financial interests by harmonising the definitions, sanctions and limitation periods of certain criminal offences affecting those interests. Under the EU's long-term budget (multiannual financial framework) for the period 2021-2027, an allocation of EUR181 million will be available to support Member States' efforts to fight fraud, corruption and other irregularities affecting the EU budget.

The EU is assisted by its specialised agencies, such as the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation, the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation and the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training. In April 2021, the European Commission presented the EU strategy to tackle organised crime. This focuses on: boosting law enforcement and judicial cooperation; enhancing effective investigations to disrupt organised crime structures and high-priority crimes; removing criminal profits ('follow the money' approach); ensuring a modern response to technological developments. The Internal Security Fund for the 2021-2027 period builds on its predecessor and adapts it to new developments, such as the need to intensify the fight against terrorism, serious and organised crime and cybercrime. The programme will support measures to: improve the sharing of information; intensify cross-border cooperation, including joint operations on terrorism and organised crime; strengthen capabilities to prevent and combat crime.

Article 83 of the treaty refers specifically to terrorism as a serious crime. The EU has various legal instruments in place to fight terrorism. For example, Directive (EU) 2017/541 on combating terrorism, which, among other things, sets the minimum rules on which acts should be qualified as terrorist offences. Another example is Regulation (EU) 2019/1148, which puts rules in place to prevent the misuse of chemicals that could be used to build homemade bombs. In July 2020, the EU presented its security union strategy. This sets out the tools and measures to be developed over the next 5 years to ensure security in our physical and digital environments. Protecting people in the EU from terrorism and organised crime is one of its strategic priorities. Terrorism and radicalisation leading to violent extremism continue to evolve as major threats to the security of Europeans and their way of life. Coordinated EU action is indispensable to ensure effective action to protect people in the EU. The EU and its Member States need to work together to fight and prevent terrorism, both online and offline. In December 2020, the European Commission therefore adopted a counterterrorism agenda for the EU, paving the way for the fight against terrorism in the years to come. The aim of the agenda is to better anticipate threats, to step up prevention efforts, to help protect people, public spaces and infrastructures and to respond effectively when terrorist attacks occur.

EU legislation covers the entire food chain — ' from farm to fork ' — in an integrated way and applying a ' One Health ' approach. It deals with safety aspects covering primary production, hygiene conditions in food processing, packaging, labelling and official controls on food safety compliance. EU food safety policy is mainly governed by Articles 168 (public health) and 169 (consumer protection) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This policy is evidence- and science-based, relying on independent, sound scientific advice given by the relevant EU agencies, notably: European Food Safety Authority (EFSA); European Medicines Agency (EMA) for veterinary medicinal products used in food-producing animals; European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) for biocidal products, such as disinfectants, insecticides, etc. The European Commission's Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety carries out audits, inspections and related non-audit activities to ensure that EU legislation on food and feed safety is properly carried out and enforced. The EU has a rapid alert system — RASFF — to protect consumers from non-compliant food and feed, and if necessary, remove it from the market. The 2020 'Farm to fork' strategy is at the heart of the European Green Deal aiming to make food systems fair, healthy and environmentally friendly.

The free movement of goods is one of the four fundamental economic freedoms laid down in the EU founding treaties, the other three being the free movement of capital, services and people. The free movement of goods in the EU has been achieved by: eliminating customs duties on imports and exports, and all charges having an equivalent effect; prohibiting quantitative restrictions (quotas) on imports and exports, and measures having an equivalent effect (essentially, all trading rules enacted by Member States, which could directly or indirectly, actually or potentially hinder trade within the EU); and removing non-tariff barriers by harmonising national legislations, eliminating barriers arising from divergent national rules by agreeing common rules, to guarantee both the free movement of goods and to respect other EU objectives, such as environmental and consumer protection. To avoid the long process of negotiating detailed harmonised rules, the EU adopted what is known as the 'new approach' to harmonisation, proposed in the European Commission's 1985 White Paper on the completion of the internal market, the guiding principle being the principle of mutual recognition of goods lawfully marketed in one Member State. Legislative harmonisation is limited to agreeing on essential (performance or functional) requirements, while technical specifications for products meeting the essential requirements are be laid down in harmonised voluntary standards. Goods meeting these requirements can be marketed throughout the EU.

With some exceptions (mentioned under Articles 51, 52 and 346 TFEU), the person providing the service may temporarily carry out their activity in the Member State where the service is provided, under the same conditions as those imposed by that Member State on its own nationals.

The directive requires Member States to remove unjustifiable or discriminatory requirements affecting the setting up or carrying out of a relevant service in their country. To meet the rights of the users of services, it requires Member States to: remove obstacles for users wanting to use services supplied by providers set up in another Member State, such as obligations to obtain an authorisation; abolish discriminatory requirements based on the user's nationality or place of residence; make available general information and assistance on legal requirements, in particular consumer protection rules, and on compensation procedures applicable in other Member States.

A number of EU treaty articles have a bearing on the free movement of workers, the most important being Article 45 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Article 45 gives citizens of an EU Member State the right to: look for a job in another Member State; work there without the need for a work permit; reside there for that purpose; stay there even after their employment has finished; enjoy equal treatment with nationals in access to employment, working conditions and all other social and tax advantages. These rights apply to individuals who exercise their right to free movement for work purposes. There are limitations based on considerations of public security, public policy, public health grounds and employment in the public sector. Where an EU national is working abroad in another Member State, family members also have the right to reside and work in that Member State, regardless of their nationality. Children also have the right to be educated in the Member State to which their parent has relocated. Under the EU's legislation on mutual recognition of professional qualifications, people working in certain occupations for which the receiving Member State requires particular professional qualifications have the right to get their professional qualifications recognised in that state. There are also rules protecting EU citizens' social security rights when they move from one Member State to another. In 2019, the European Labour Authority, a body designed to help ensure fair labour mobility across the EU and support the coordination of social security systems, was set up. Free movement of workers also applies to citizens of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, whose countries belong to the European Economic Area.

It is based on Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and on Article 67 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In this area with no internal borders, citizens can move about freely. The AFSJ also includes measures in respect to external border controls, asylum and immigration, as well as in regard to preventing and fighting crime. The legally binding EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights consolidates all the fundamental rights applicable at the European Union (EU) level. In addition to protecting civil and political rights, it covers workers' social rights, data protection, bioethics and the right to good administration. Policy and legislation under the EU's freedom and security policy embrace a wide range of important themes including: citizens' free movement throughout the EU with no border checks at internal borders – Schengen Agreement; a common asylum and immigration policy; border controls at external borders based on solidarity between EU countries and what is equitable in regard to non-EU citizens. The EU aims to ensure a high level of safety for its citizens. It seeks to achieve this by measures to prevent crime, racism and xenophobia, as well as by measures to promote coordination and cooperation between police (Europol) and judicial (Eurojust) authorities. EU police cooperation is developing. This involves EU countries' competent authorities such as police forces, customs and other services specialised in areas such as crime prevention, detection or investigation. In March 2014, the European Commission adopted a communication entitled The EU Justice Agenda for 2020 – Strengthening Trust, Mobility and Growth within the Union.

These rights which are fundamental to individuals living in the EU are laid down in the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights. The charter became legally binding across the EU with the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon in December 2009. The term 'human rights' is generally used in international law and refers to rights pertaining to all humans irrespective of their nationality, race, caste, creed, gender, etc. The EU tends to use the term 'human rights' in the context of its external relations and development cooperation policies. The charter applies to the EU institutions, subject to the principle of subsidiarity, and cannot extend the powers and tasks conferred upon them by the treaties. It also applies to EU Member States when they implement EU law. Many of the rights and freedoms contained in the EU's charter reflect those already enshrined in the Council of Europe's European Convention on Human Rights (1950) and Social Charter (1965, and revised in 1996). The EU's Fundamental Rights Agency, based in Vienna, Austria, and replacing the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, was set up in 2007 to safeguard the rights, values and freedoms enshrined in the EU's Charter. Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union allows for the possibility of suspending EU membership rights (such as voting rights in the Council) if a country seriously and persistently breaches the principles on which the EU is founded (liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the rule of law).

It is a civilian system under civilian control, and provides positioning, navigation and timing information for a variety of public and private users. Currently, the number of users has already reached two billion worldwide. Although Galileo has been designed to function independently of other existing systems, it is fully compatible with the US GPS. This allows receiver manufacturers and application developers to develop devices that work seamlessly with more than one system. The Galileo infrastructure consists of a constellation of satellites and a global network of ground stations. The signals broadcast by the system provide outstanding services that can be used in a large variety of sectors such as transport (road, aviation, maritime, rail), agriculture, mapping and surveying, etc. Galileo is also being increasingly used in drones to ensure smooth navigation, and in search and rescue operations to save lives. In addition, location-based services and very accurate timing services provide opportunities for network synchronisation in the energy and telecommunications sectors. The EU Agency for the Space Programme (EUSPA) is an agency responsible for the operations and service provision of Galileo and EGNOS, the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service, which improves satellite navigation performances over Europe mainly for safety-of-life applications. Galileo is used in applications and devices ranging from smartphones to wearables and from aircraft to personal vehicles. The following legislation makes use of the benefits of Galileo: As of April 2018, all new car models sold in the EU must be equipped with Galileo capabilities, as required by the eCall regulation (Regulation (EU) 2015/758). As of June 2019, smart tachographs need to be compatible with Galileo (Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/799). As of October 2021, on-board equipment which uses satellite navigation, associated with electronic road toll systems, needs to be compatible with Galileo (Directive (EU) 2019/520). As of March 2022, all smartphones sold in the EU must incorporate GNSS capabilities, at least Galileo capability, so that the satellite navigation information can provide caller location information to the emergency services in emergencies(Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/320).

It results from the increase in trade and capital movements, the movement of people and ideas and the spread of information, knowledge and technology. This process, both geographic and sectorial, is not recent and has been accelerating over the past three decades. Globalisation is the source of many opportunities for the European Union (EU), such as lower prices and greater choice for consumers. However, due to competition from low-wage countries, it can also have downsides, including job loss and downward pressures on wages and working conditions, as well as the relocation of jobs outside of the EU (off-shoring). To address the challenges that globalisation presents within its borders, the EU: takes measures to improve the functioning of EU markets and boost innovation performance; helps to shorten the adjustment process; and by means of targeted policy actions, such as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), helps workers who lose their jobs due to the relocation of production outside the EU by funding aspects such as training, careers advice and assistance to find a new job. Through its trade policy, the EU manages the opportunities that globalisation offers to: open up external markets in order to increase trade opportunities through trade agreements; and protect EU producers from unfair competition by means of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy rules. Both the EU and the individual EU countries are members of the World Trade Organization. Because trade is an exclusive competence of the EU, the European Commission negotiates on behalf of the EU countries. This gives the EU more weight in negotiations setting global trade rules designed to keep the world's trading system predictable and fair.

Web accessibility removes barriers to communication and interaction that many people face. However, when websites, applications, technologies or tools are badly designed, they can create barriers that exclude people from using the web. Accessibility is essential for developers and organisations that want to create high-quality websites, apps and web tools without excluding anyone – not just users with disabilities – from using their products and services. Businesses with accessible services can reach a larger, mostly untapped customer base, and experience economic gain from doing so. An estimated 100 million people in the European Union (EU) have some form of disability, representing an important market. Web accessibility is not only about technical standards, web architecture and design. It is a matter of political will and moral obligation, enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) develops international standards for the web. The W3C web accessibility initiative develops standards and support materials to spread understanding about web accessibility and its implementation. The EU's web accessibility directive (Directive (EU) 2016/2102) has been in force since 22 December 2016. It aims to give people with disabilities better access to websites and mobile apps so that they can take a full and active part in the digital economy and society. The European Commission set up the Web Accessibility Directive Expert Group to support the directive's implementation, to facilitate cooperation between EU Member States and stakeholders and to share best practices. Examples of web accessibility include the following. Text colour, contrast, and size. Colour, contrast and text size are important accessibility and readability issues for those with sight impairments or conditions such as colour blindness. Assistive technology. Some people cannot use a mouse, including many older users. An accessible website does not rely on the mouse; instead, it makes all functionality available from a keyboard. People with disabilities can then also use speech input or use other assistive technologies that mimic the keyboard. Video and audio. Providing a text transcript makes audio information accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Being able to listen to a text when there is not enough light to read, or when multitasking, and being able to read subtitles in a noisy environment are also important.

It measures the concessionality (softness) of a loan,calculated as the difference between the face value of a loan and the discounted present value of the service payments the borrower will make over the lifetime of the loan, expressed as a percentage of the face value. Four factors determine the grant element: interest rate (per cent per annum); grace period, i.e. the interval from commitment date to the date of the first payment of amortisation; maturity, i.e. the interval from commitment date to the date of the last payment of amortisation; and discount rate used to determine the present value of future payments. For bilateral loans to the official sector, the discount rates used in the ODA calculation are differentiated by DAC income group: 9 per cent in the case of loans to LDCs and other LICs, 7 per cent in the case of loans to LMICs and 6 per cent in the case of loans to UMICs. For loans to multilateral institutions, the discount rate is 5 per cent in the case of global institutions and multilateral development banks, and 6 per cent for other multilateral organisations, including sub-regional organisations. For bilateral loans to the official sector, minimum grant elements for qualifying as ODA are also differentiated by DAC income group: 45 per cent in the case of loans to LDCs and other LICs, 15 per cent in the case of loans to LMICs and 10 per cent in the case of loans to UMICs. For loans to multilateral institutions, it is 10 per cent. [Note: the grant element concept is not applied to the market-based lending operations of the multilateral development banks.

It is low carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive'. It is an economy which recognises the true value of environmental resources and ecosystems and is closely related to the term 'sustainable development', since both relate to the aim of conserving environmental resources for future generations. In December 2019, the European Commission issued its European Green Deal communication. This set out the growth strategy for the European Union (EU), taking into account its commitment to tackle climate and environmental challenges, and transform it into a modern, resource-efficient and competitive economy. The Green Deal aims to make the EU climate-neutral by 2050, boost the economy through green technology, create sustainable industry and transport, and cut pollution. The intention is to turn climate and environmental challenges into opportunities which will make the transition to the EU's green economy just and inclusive for all. The challenges facing EU Member States to make their transition towards a green and climate-neutral economy are immense, especially for those that depend on fossil fuels and carbon-intensive industries. The EU has set in place the Just Transition Mechanism to support them in their transition.

Implied – or implicit – powers are, however, powers that have not been explicitly conferred upon the EU in the treaties but derive either from the explicitly conferred powers or the objectives of the EU. The doctrine of implied powers has been recognised by the Court of Justice of the European Union on several occasions, such as in the European agreement on road transport case (Case 22-70), when it ruled that the EU has the right to negotiate international agreements in matters where it has competence to adopt internal rules. Thus, in addition to the competences explicitly conferred on the EU by the Member States, this doctrine gives the EU the competences necessary to achieve certain objectives of the treaties, even though the treaties have not provided for powers of action to do so. Article 352(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) sets out the basis for the use of implied power. It allows the EU to adopt measures relating to a policy or an objective defined in the treaties, but for which it has not been specifically given the powers to do so, under certain circumstances. The conditions to be met are that the Council of the European Union, having received the European Parliament's consent, votes unanimously in favour of the appropriate measures on the basis of a proposal from the European Commission. In the event that such measures are adopted by the Council in accordance with a special legislative procedure, it must also act unanimously on a proposal from the Commission and having already obtained the consent of the European Parliament. The Commission is required to draw the attention of Member States' parliaments to any proposals it issues based on Article 352 TFEU. Article 352 TFEU may not be used as a basis for measures that entail harmonisation of national laws or for regulations where the EU treaties exclude such harmonisation, nor may it serve as a basis for attaining objectives relating to the common foreign and security policy. All acts adopted using Article 352 TFEU as a basis must respect the limits set out in Article 40(2) TEU.

These include the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights, and respect for these values is a condition for countries to gain EU membership. It follows that countries, once they become EU Member States, must uphold these values. The concept of the rule of law encapsulates aspects such as the independence of the courts from the other branches of government (executive and legislative). All members of a society and branches of government (executive and legislative) are thus subject to the law, under the control of an independent legal system, irrespective of political majorities. This is echoed in Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which concerns the rights to an effective remedy and to a fair trial, reflecting the values espoused in Article 2 TEU, and in Article 19(1) TEU, which requires Member States to put measures in place to ensure effective legal protection in the fields covered by EU law. Over the years, the Court of Justice of the European Union has played an important role in safeguarding judicial independence in the Member States. A landmark judgment in the Associação Sindical dos Juízes Portugueses case (Case C-64/16), brought before the Court of Justice via the preliminary reference procedure, clarified that the EU principle of judicial independence presupposes that the courts exercise their judicial functions wholly autonomously, without being subject to any hierarchical constraint or subordinated to any other body and without taking orders or instructions from any source whatsoever, and that the legal system is thus protected against external interventions or pressure liable to impair the independent judgment of its members or influence their decisions. The EU has a number of tools at its disposal to ensure the respect of the rule of law in all Member States (rule-of-law toolbox), such as the EU justice scoreboard, the Rule-of-Law Mechanism (with an annual rule-of-law report at its centre) and the European semester. Every year, as part of the EU's rule-of-law toolbox, the European Commission presents the EU justice scoreboard. The scoreboard provides a comparative overview of EU justice systems, using indicators focusing on the efficiency, quality and independence of justice – the essential parameters of effective justice systems. Complementing this is the annual rule-of-law report, the first edition of which was published in 2020, which provides a country-specific summary of significant developments in this field in Member States.

Through the IPCR, the Presidency of the Council of the European Union coordinates the political response to the crisis by bringing together the affected Member States, EU institutions and other key participants. In 2013 the IPCR arrangements replaced the emergency and crisis coordination arrangements adopted by the Council in 2006, which functioned at the time as a platform for exchanging information and coordinating action between EU Member States. Council Implementing Decision (EU) 2018/1993 codifies the IPCR arrangements into a legal act and sets out how the IPCR arrangements are to be implemented. The IPCR is designed to be flexible and scalable, drawing upon existing resources, structures and capabilities. The work of IPCR is supported by a number of IPCR tools: informal roundtables aimed at informing political decision-making, with relevant participants as decided by the Presidency; integrated situational awareness and analysis (ISAA) reports to inform discussions in IPCR roundtables and provide decision-makers with a clear common picture of the situation, prepared by the European Commission and the European External Action Service; a dedicated IPCR web platform to act as an electronic hub between relevant stakeholders to exchange and gather information, and restricted to those stakeholders; a central 24/7 contact point within the Commission's Emergency Response Coordination Centre, to liaise with key participants. The IPCR is scalable. It has two activation modes – information-sharing mode and full activation mode – and a monitoring mode designed to support the monitoring of an emerging or abating crisis: full activation mode supports overall strategic coordination by identifying key gaps or bottlenecks and by preparing possible options for response; information-sharing mode establishes a clear picture of the situation through the publication of the ISAA and prepares the ground for a possible full activation; monitoring mode enables the sharing of information and existing reports. The Presidency decides which one to use at any given moment, depending on the gravity of the crisis and the need to steer the response at the political level, and can escalate or de-escalate the activation mode accordingly. The decision to activate or deactivate the IPCR is the prerogative of the Presidency, except in the case of the invocation of the solidarity clause (Article 222 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) where the IPCR will be activated automatically in full mode. The decision to activate IPCR in information-sharing mode can also be taken by the General-Secretariat of the Council, the Commission and the EEAS, in consultation with the Presidency. Both the information-sharing and the full activation modes trigger the production of ISAA reports. Roundtables are held when the IPCR is activated in full mode, but can be held under information-sharing mode if deemed necessary, on an ad hoc basis. The IPCR is currently activated in full mode for the situation in the Middle East, for Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, and for migration matters. As of 2 May 2023, the IPCR activations for COVID-19 and for the earthquakes in Türkiye and Syria have been deactivated and switched to monitoring mode.

The aim is to have an area without internal frontiers or regulatory obstacles in which the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital is ensured in accordance with the articles of the Treaties. Free movement of goods (Articles 26 and 28-37 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)) With the creation of the internal market, customs duties and quantitative restrictions were eliminated. The free movement of goods relies on the principles of mutual recognition of national technical rules, the removal of physical and technical barriers, and standardisation. In 2008, a new legislative framework was adopted boosting the free movement of goods by means of the EU's market surveillance system and the CE mark. Free movement of capital (Articles 63 to 66 TFEU) Restrictions on capital movements and payments, between EU countries as well as between EU countries and with non-EU countries have been prohibited since 2004, as a result of the Maastricht Treaty. However, there are some exceptions that are primarily linked to taxation and public policy considerations. The free movement of capital contributes to economic growth by enabling capital to be invested efficiently and promotes the use of the euro as an international currency. Freedom of establishment and to provide services (Articles 26, 49 to 62 TFEU) The freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services guarantee mobility of businesses and professionals within the EU. The self-employed and professionals or legal persons within the meaning of Article 54 TFEU who are legally operating in one EU country may: carry out an economic activity in a stable and continuous way in another EU country (freedom of establishment: Article 49 TFEU); and offer and provide their services in other EU countries on a temporary basis while remaining in their country of origin (freedom to provide services: Article 56 TFEU). Free movement of workers (Articles 26 and 45-48 TFEU) This covers aspects such as the rights of movement and residence for workers, the rights of entry and residence for family members, and it entails the abolition of any discrimination based on nationality as regards employment, remuneration and other conditions of work and employment. Restrictions may apply for the public service. The European Labour Authority serves as a dedicated agency for the free movement of workers, including posted workers. Having no regulatory obstacles to free movement means: EU businesses benefit from: a large market of over 400 million consumers; access to many suppliers of goods and services within the single market; lower costs because of economies of scale and harmonised rules, standards and requirements across the territory. EU citizens benefit from: the creation of additional jobs; lower prices and a wider selection of products and services; quality and safety, assured by harmonised rules and standards; the benefits of more innovation, research and development; the opportunity to live, work, study and do business throughout the EU; selling goods and moving money without restrictions. Some non-EU countries also align their rules to those of the single market, extending its effects beyond the EU. These include non-EU members of the European Economic Area: Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Switzerland also trades with the single market through bilateral agreements with the EU. Candidate and potential candidate countries also seek to align their legislation with the EU acquis as one of the conditions of their future membership of the EU.

In addition, the EU needs to improve its resilience to crises and disasters. The EU's ISS is thus its joint agenda to use all the resources and expertise available to jointly tackle these challenges. In June 2014, the European Commission published a report assessing the progress made under the ISS and identifying its future priorities for a renewed ISS.

In 2020, the EU set out its main priorities for the 2020-2025 period in its EU security union strategy. The strategy sets out four strategic EU-level priorities: ensuring a future-proof security environment for individuals and ensuring safe and resilient critical infrastructures; tackling evolving threats, such as cybercrime, illegal online content and hybrid threats; protecting Europeans from terrorism and organised crime, including developing action plans against migrant smuggling, drugs and firearms trafficking; developing a strong European security ecosystem by combating crime and promoting justice by closer cooperation and information sharing.

According to Article 216 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the EU can conclude agreements with one or more non-EU countries or international organisations, provided the conclusion of an agreement: is necessary to achieve, within the context of the EU's policies, one of the objectives referred to in the treaties; or is provided for in a legally binding EU act; or is likely to affect common rules or alter their scope. When negotiating and signing an international agreement, the EU must respect the limits of its competences and the general principles on the EU's external action, as set out in Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union. Article 218 of the TFEU establishes a general procedure for the exercise of treaty-making powers. In negotiating and concluding international agreements, the EU, which has legal personality, either has: exclusive competence for negotiating and concluding the agreements alone – in which case Article 3 of the TFEU specifies the areas in which the EU has exclusive competence (they include trade agreements); or shared competence to do so with its Member States, if they are also involved in concluding the agreements – in which case the areas of shared competence are listed in Article 4 of the TFEU (they include fields such as consumer protection or environment); agreements relating to such fields are known as mixed agreements. International agreements concluded by the EU are binding on its institutions and Member States, and the latter are thus obligated to adhere to their provisions. They are an integral part of EU law and fall into a category of their own, being separate from primary and secondary legislation. They can have direct effect and their legal force is superior to that of secondary legislation, which must therefore comply with them. Where the EU has exclusive competence, the Council of the European Union draws up a mandate for the European Commission, which then negotiates the agreement, except in the field of foreign and security policy, where the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy represents the EU. Once the negotiations have been completed and, depending on the kind of the agreement, the European Parliament has given its consent or was consulted, the Council signs and concludes agreements on the EU's behalf. In the case of an agreement in a field in which the EU shares competence with its Member States, representatives from Member States also have to give their mandates for negotiations to begin. The most common types of international agreement include association agreements, free trade agreements, economic partnership agreements and partnership and cooperation agreements.

Over the years, the extent of EU development cooperation has gradually increased. The EU is now the world's largest donor, working with some 160 countries. Development cooperation has to be conducted in accordance with the principles and objectives of the EU's external action. Its primary aim is to reduce and, in the long term, eradicate poverty in the world by promoting the sustainable economic, social and environmental development of developing countries in line with the United Nations' sustainable development goals. The guiding principles of EU external action and development cooperation are found in Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union and Article 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, respectively. The EU's instruments for financing external action have undergone a rationalisation in recent years. Since the adoption of the multiannual financial framework for the 2021–2027 period, the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument – Global Europe is the main financing instrument for the EU's external action. It covers cooperation with all non-EU countries, other than overseas countries and territories and countries receiving pre-accession funding. Prior to 2021, the European Development Fund (which was not part of the EU budget) was the EU's main instrument for development aid to the 79 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries and the overseas countries and territories. In the latest EU multiannual financial framework (2021–2027), cooperation with ACP countries was brought under the EU budget and is covered by the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument – Global Europe. Although the 2000 agreement between the EU and the ACP countries (the Cotonou Agreement) was due to expire in 2020, its application has been extended until 30 September 2023, unless the new ACP–EU partnership agreement enters into force or is provisionally applied before that date.

The resulting compromise laid down that if members of the Council representing between 23 votes (the old blocking minority threshold — number of votes needed to block a decision the approval of which needs a requires qualified majority for approval) and 26 votes (the new blocking minority threshold) demonstrated their intention to block a Council decision by qualified majority, the Council would do all within its power, within a reasonable space of time, to reach a satisfactory solution that could be adopted by at least 68 votes out of 87. Article 16 of the Treaty on European Union introduces a new definition of the rule of qualified majority which applies from 1 November 2014 onwards. However, between that date and 31 March 2017, it was possible for each EU Member State to ask for the previous weighting rules to be applied. It was also possible to apply the 'Ioannina compromise'. This enabled countries representing at least three quarters of the EU's population or at least three quarters of the number of Member States required to form a blocking minority, to block the vote for a Council act by qualified majority, in order to try to find a solution within a reasonable space of time. From 1 April 2017, the new rule of qualified majority became compulsory. The activating percentage of the 'Ioannina compromise' was reduced to at least 55% of the EU's population or at least 55% of the number of Member States required to constitute a blocking minority.

The main objective of judicial cooperation in civil matters is to improve collaboration between EU countries' authorities in order to eliminate all obstacles stemming from incompatibility between the various judicial and administrative systems (mutual recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments, access to justice and harmonisation of national legislation). In 1993, the Maastricht Treaty included judicial cooperation in civil matters in its Title VI. The Amsterdam Treaty transferred judicial cooperation in civil matters to Title IV of the EC Treaty (Article 65), thus ´communitising` it and including it in the area of freedom, security and justice (AFSJ). The Tampere European Council (October 1999) made the principle of mutual recognition of judgments the true cornerstone of judicial cooperation in both civil and criminal matters within the EU. With the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty in December 2009, judicial cooperation in civil matters was moved under Title V of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, together with all other aspects of the area of freedom, security and justice. Since then, decisions in this field are taken in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, except for issues relating to family law.

It is based on Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and on Article 67 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In this area with no internal borders, citizens can move about freely. The AFSJ also includes measures in respect to external border controls, asylum and immigration, as well as in regard to preventing and fighting crime. The legally binding EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights consolidates all the fundamental rights applicable at the European Union (EU) level. In addition to protecting civil and political rights, it covers workers' social rights, data protection, bioethics and the right to good administration. The primary aim of the EU's justice policy is to create an EU-wide area of justice based on mutual cooperation in the fields of both civil and criminal law. This entails building up mutual trust among EU countries' courts and national administrations and their mutual recognition of judicial decisions. In the area of civil law, the EU has introduced a wide range of measures. These seek to give citizens greater legal certainty and easy and effective access to justice when they are involved in issues of a cross-border nature, such as disputes, divorces, etc. In the EU, where people and goods can move around freely, it is important to establish a European area of justice. To address the challenges posed by crime, the EU has introduced laws that seek to ensure that the rights of victims, suspects and prisoners are safeguarded in cross-border cases (such as on mutual legal assistance, the mutual recognition of decisions in criminal cases and the European Arrest Warrant). In both the criminal and civil law areas, measures have been adopted to: simplify procedures enabling national courts to cooperate with their equivalents in other EU countries, train professionals involved in cross-border cases, and develop information and communication technologies (like videoconferencing) in the EU's justice system (e-Justice). In March 2014, the European Commission adopted a communication entitled The EU Justice Agenda for 2020 – Strengthening Trust, Mobility and Growth within the Union. This outlines its vision for the future of EU justice policy.

The Protocol entered into force in 2005. Under the Kyoto's Protocol first commitment period, the industrialised countries committed to reducing their emissions of 6 greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride) by an average of 5% between 2008-2012 compared with 1990 levels. The EU and 15 EU countries -its members at the time Kyoto was adopted -committed to an 8% cut for the bloc as a whole. To bridge the gap between the end of the 1st Kyoto period in 2012 and the start of the new global agreement in 2020, an amendment to the Kyoto Protocol was adopted at the Doha (Qatar) climate change conference in December 2012. Parties agreed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 18% below 1990 levels in the 2013-2020 period. The EU, the EU countries and Iceland have agreed to meet a 20% reduction target to be fulfilled jointly and are on track to do so. Furthermore, the list of GHGs covered by the Protocol was extended to include nitrogen trifluoride. Under the Protocol, parties must meet their targets primarily through national measures. However, the Protocol also offers them additional means to meet their targets by way of 3 market-based mechanisms. The Kyoto mechanisms are: emissions trading between parties which signed the Protocol, joint implementation of projects by these parties, and the clean development mechanism (with parties which did not sign the Protocol). Under the Protocol, parties' actual emissions are monitored and precise records are kept of the trades carried out. The Commission publishes annually the Kyoto and EU 2020 Progress Report, which provides information about the progress made by the European Union and EU countries towards their greenhouse gas emission targets.", "Related": [], "Referenced Source": "EUR Lex Glossary", "Synonym": null}

This right of initiative gives the Commission considerable power in shaping EU policy and legislation. However, as the treaty article makes clear, the Commission does not have the monopoly for initiating legislative proposals. The European Parliament may, under Article 225 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), 'acting by a majority of its component Members, request the Commission to submit any appropriate proposal on matters on which it considers that a Union act is required for the purpose of implementing the Treaties'. The treaties also stipulate the cases where the Parliament has a direct right of initiative: for decisions relating to its own composition (Article 14 TEU), for the provisions on the election of its members (Article 223(1) TFEU), for the general conditions governing the performance of its members' duties (Article 223(2) TFEU), for the rules governing the exercise of its right of inquiry (Article 226 TFEU) and for the regulations and general conditions governing the performance of the Ombudsman's duties (Article 228 TFEU). A European Council summit may call on the Commission to draw up policy proposals. The Council of the European Union, under Article 241 TFEU, 'acting by a simple majority, may request the Commission to undertake any studies the Council considers desirable for the attainment of the common objectives, and to submit to it any appropriate proposals'. Under Article 11 TEU and Article 24 TFEU, the citizens' initiative allows citizens to invite the Commission to submit proposals on which they believe EU legislation should be adopted. Once an initiative has reached one million signatures from at least seven EU Member States (each country has a minimum threshold), the Commission has to decide what action to take, if any. In the context of the ordinary legislative procedure, legislative proposals may also be put forward by the following: a quarter of the Member States (under Article 76 TFEU), the Court of Justice (under Article 257 TFEU), and the European Central Bank (under Article 40 of Protocol No 4). The legislative process (ordinary legislative procedure or special legislative procedure) used to adopt legislative proposals is determined by the treaty article that forms the legal basis of the act.

It is designed to: identify potential risks at an early stage (an alert mechanism), prevent the emergence of harmful macroeconomic imbalances, and correct any imbalances that are already in place. The alert mechanism uses 14 indicators (e.g. trends in export market shares, net international investment, labour costs and private and public sector debt) to identify potential risks. The European Commission may propose that the Council issues recommendations to countries identified as having imbalances. Countries with excessive imbalances may be subject to an enhanced process of specific monitoring or may enter the Excessive Imbalance Procedure (EIP). An EIP may eventually lead to sanctions for euro area countries in cases of repeated lack of compliance with obligations.

Although such operations may have a positive impact on the market, they may also appreciably restrict competition, if they create or strengthen a dominant market player. In order to preclude restrictions of competition, the European Commission exercises control over planned concentrations with an EU dimension (i.e. when the operation extends beyond the borders of an EU country and exceeds certain worldwide and EU-wide turnover thresholds). It may then authorise them subject to conditions or forbid them. In determining whether a concentration is compatible with the common market, the Commission takes account on a case-by-case basis of several factors, such as the concepts of 'EU dimension', 'dominant position', 'effective competition' and 'relevant market'. The basic criterion used to analyse concentrations is that of a 'dominant position'. One or more firms are said to hold a dominant position if they have the economic power to influence the parameters of competition, especially prices, production, product quality, distribution and innovation, and to limit competition to an appreciable extent. EU rules for the control of concentrations are found in Regulation (EC) No 139/2004, which entered into force on 1 May 2004.

Article 77 TFEU requires the EU to develop a policy on border checks on persons and efficient monitoring of the external borders, the absence of controls on persons at the internal borders and the gradual introduction of an integrated border management system for the external borders. Article 78 TFEU requires the EU to develop a common policy on asylum, subsidiary protection and temporary protection, with a view to offering appropriate status to any non-EU national requiring international protection and ensuring compliance with the principle of non-refoulement (a core principle of international refugee and human rights law that prohibits states from returning individuals to a country where there is a real risk of being subjected to persecution, torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or any other human rights violation). Under Article 79 TFEU, EU immigration policy seeks to manage migration flows, to ensure the fair treatment of non-EU nationals residing legally in Member States, and to prevent and combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings. On legal immigration, the EU has the power to lay down the conditions governing entry into and legal residence in a Member State, including for the purposes of family reunification, for non-EU nationals. Member States, however, have discretion over the number of non-EU nationals who may be admitted to seek work. The EU seeks to prevent and reduce illegal immigration, in particular by means of an effective returns and readmissions policy, in a manner that respects human rights. According to Article 80 TFEU, the EU's policy on migration and asylum is governed by the principle of solidarity and the fair sharing of responsibility, including its financial implications, between the Member States. Over the years, the EU has been developing and refining its common approach to migration and asylum. Since 1999, the EU has been working towards establishing a common European asylum system. In 2020, the European Commission published its New Pact on Migration, covering all of the different elements needed for a comprehensive European approach to migration and seeking to ensure greater consistency in integrating the internal and external facets of migration policies. The Commission proposes improved and faster, better integrated procedures throughout the asylum and migration system and seeks to ensure a balanced, common framework bringing together all aspects of asylum and migration policy. It recognises that effective returns require improved procedures inside the EU that reduce the fragmentation of national approaches and bring closer cooperation and reinforced solidarity between all Member States. The EU's policy on migration and asylum applies to all Member States, with the exception of Denmark, which has an opt-out in accordance with Protocol 22, and Ireland, which enjoys the right to opt-in to specific measures in accordance with Protocol 21. The EU's policy on borders belongs to the Schengen acquis and applies to Member States and the Schengen associated countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland) in accordance with Protocol 19. Ireland does not participate in measures of the Schengen acquis relating to borders.

Climate change can be mitigated, to make its impact less severe, by preventing or reducing the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere. Records suggest that, particularly since the middle of the 20th century, humans and the GHGs that they generate (mainly carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxides and fluorinated gases) have rapidly accelerated climate change. The international community has recognised the need to keep global warming well below 2 degreesC and agreed to aim to limit it to 1.5 degreesC. The EU has a comprehensive framework of policies to reduce GHG emissions. Key EU legislation and policies include: the EU Emissions Trading System to reduce GHG emissions from the power sector, industry and flights within the EU; national targets under the effort sharing regulation; ensuring that the EU's forests and land contribute to the fight against climate change (Land use and forestry regulation for 2021–2030); reducing GHG emissions from transport, e.g. through CO2 emission standards for vehicles; boosting energy efficiency, renewable energy and governance of the Member States' energy and climate policies. In 2019, the European Commission adopted the European Green Deal — an ambitious agenda for the EU to become climate neutral (that is, an economy with net zero GHG emissions) by 2050 — and this was enshrined in the new European climate law. All parts of society and economic sectors will play a role in achieving this — from the power sector to industry, mobility, buildings, agriculture and forestry. Since 2020, the Commission has adopted a series of new strategic initiatives, notably a new circular economy action plan for a clean and competitive Europe, a biodiversity strategy for 2030 and a 'Farm to fork' strategy, as well as an EU strategy on adaptation to climate change, which complements its mitigating actions. In 2020, the Commission put forward a 2030 climate target plan to further reduce net GHG emissions by at least 55% by 2030. The new 2030 target is now enshrined in the European climate law. In July 2021, the Commission also adopted a series of legislative proposals setting out how it intends to achieve climate neutrality in the EU by 2050, including an intermediate target of at least a 55% net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. The EU's 8th environment action programme, to run from 2021 to 2030, will support the European Green Deal's climate action and environment objectives.

The EU is working to prevent the misuse of the financial system and to improve cooperation between EU Member States to fight against money laundering. Its measures are governed by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU): under Title VII (approximation of laws for the internal market): with the creation of the internal market, rules were implemented throughout the EU in order to effectively prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Financial movements are regulated to ensure that transactions can be fully traced and monitored. Financial and certain non-financial operators must also identify their clients (including beneficial owners of companies and trusts), monitor transactions and report any suspicions of money laundering to Financial Intelligence Units; under Title V (police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters): focuses on defining offences and on strengthening mutual assistance. EU financial crime rules are mostly based on international standards adopted by the Financial Action Task Force. Directive (EU) 2018/843 – the EU's Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, which amends the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (Directive (EU) 2015/849) – aims to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism by preventing the financial market from being misused for these purposes. Directive (EU) 2018/1673 aims to criminalise money laundering when it is intentional and with the knowledge that the property came from criminal activity. It defines criminal offences and sanctions in the area of money laundering and allows Member States to criminalise money laundering where the offender suspected or ought to have known that the property came from criminal activity. In 2020, the European Commission adopted an EU action plan on preventing money laundering and terrorist financing, which includes measures it will take to better enforce, supervise and coordinate the relevant EU rules. At the same time, it published a method to identify high-risk non-EU countries with deficient anti-money laundering and countering terrorist financing regimes that pose significant threats to the EU's financial system.

Article 12 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and Protocol No 1 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) give national Parliaments the right to receive information directly from the EU institutions on legislative programmes, consultative documents, Council of the European Union minutes, etc., in addition to EU legislative acts. Article 5 TEU and Protocol No 2 TFEU give them the right to object to EU proposals on the basis of subsidiarity. Where national Parliaments consider that legislative acts proposed by the European Commission do not comply with subsidiarity, they have the right to send a reasoned opinion to the Commission within 8 weeks of transmission of the draft in all official EU languages. Each Member State's national Parliament is allocated two votes. If the Commission receives reasoned opinions representing at least one third of the votes allocated to the national Parliaments (or a quarter in the case of proposals in the area of justice, freedom and security), it is required to review its proposal and decide whether to maintain, amend or withdraw it. It must then justify its decision for doing so. This system is known as the yellow card procedure. Where the Commission receives reasoned opinions representing a majority of the national Parliament votes and the proposal falls under the ordinary legislative procedure, the Commission must review its proposal and decide whether to maintain, amend or withdraw it. Where it decides to maintain it, it must justify its decision to do so to the European Parliament and the Council, explaining why the proposal complies with the principle of subsidiarity. This is known as the orange card procedure. Where a majority of members of the European Parliament or 55% of members of the Council consider a proposal does not comply with the subsidiarity principle, the proposal is rejected. Under Article 70 TFEU, national Parliaments must be kept informed of the evaluation system of Member States' policy implementation in the area of freedom, security and justice. Articles 85 and 88 TFEU permit their scrutiny of European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation and European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation activities.

EU countries designate SPAs for rare and migratory bird species under the birds directive. They also propose sites for protection under the habitats directive for species of fauna and flora and habitats that are of special interest because of their rarity or vulnerability, or risk of extinction. On the basis of these proposals and within the framework nine bio-geographical regions of the EU (Alpine, Atlantic, Black Sea, Boreal, Continental, Macaronesian, Mediterranean, Pannonian and Steppic), the European Commission adopts sites of community importance.

The EU hosts a wide range of animal and plant species and a variety of natural habitats. According to the European Environment Agency, most protected species in Europe have a poor or bad conservation status. Protecting nature is important for several reasons: it is crucial for the survival of species and their habitats; it is essential for human wellbeing because: our societies and economies rely upon ecosystem services, such as clean water and air, pollination, climate regulation and sources of nutrition or medicines, well-functioning ecosystems prevent the emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases (infectious diseases which can spread from animals to people); it is vital to protect our shared natural heritage. The EU has played and continues to play an important role at international level in nature protection and conservation. It is party to several conventions including: the Convention on the Conservation of Wetlands, adopted in Ramsar (1971); the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, known as CITES, adopted in Washington (1973); the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, adopted in Bonn (1979); the Convention on the Protection of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, adopted in Bern (1982); the Convention on Biological Diversity, adopted in Rio de Janeiro (1992). The EU is also bound by the Aarhus Convention (1998), which concerns public access to environmental information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice. The EU has committed itself to protecting and restoring biodiversity. The EU's first legislation to protect nature was the original Birds Directive, adopted in 1979 and codified and replaced, in 2009, by Directive 2009/147/EC. The Directive provides comprehensive protection to all wild bird species naturally occurring in the EU. In 1992, the Habitats Directive (Directive 92/43/EEC) was adopted to help maintain biodiversity by protecting over 1,000 animal and plant species and over 200 types of habitats, and introducing the Natura 2000 network of protected areas across Europe. The Natura 2000 network's Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas currently (2021) account for around 18% of EU's land and 9% of EU seas. The EU's nature-related legislation also deals with: invasive alien species (animals and plants introduced accidentally or deliberately into a natural environment where they are not normally present, with serious negative consequences for their new environment); wildlife trade (rules implementing CITES, which go beyond the convention's requirements, trade in seal products, and humane trapping standards); the role of zoos in the conservation of biodiversity. Since the mid-2000s, the EU has adopted a series of biodiversity action plans and strategies. The latest one, the 2030 Biodiversity Strategy, aims to protect nature and reverse the degradation of ecosystems. The strategy aims to put Europe's biodiversity on a path to recovery by 2030, and contains over 100 specific actions and commitments. It is the proposal for the EU's contribution to the international negotiations on the global post-2020 biodiversity framework. A core part of the European Green Deal, it will also support a green recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic.

This means that individuals or groups of individuals which are in comparable situations should not be treated less favourably simply because of a particular characteristic such as their sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) prohibits discrimination on grounds of nationality. It also enables the Council of the European Union to take appropriate action to combat discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. In this matter, the Council must act unanimously and after obtaining the European Parliament's consent. However, in the specific area of equal treatment and equal opportunities for men and women, the ordinary legislative procedure applies, which does not require unanimity but only qualified majority (Article 157 TFEU). Discrimination on the grounds of nationality has always been forbidden by the European Union (EU) treaties, as has discrimination on the basis of sex in the context of employment. The other grounds of discrimination were mentioned for the first time in 1997, with the signature of the Treaty of Amsterdam. In 2000, two directives were adopted: the employment equality directive (Directive 2000/78/EC), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, religious belief, age and disability in the area of employment; the racial equality directive (Directive 2000/43/EC), which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race or ethnicity, again in the area of employment but also in areas such as education, social protection including social security and healthcare, social advantages and access to and supply of goods and services, including housing. These directives apply to non-EU nationals and to stateless people but do not cover differences of treatment based on their legal status and on nationality. EU legislation also protects people against discrimination based on their sex in the above areas, except for education. In 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon introduced a horizontal clause with a view to integrating the fight against discrimination into all EU policies and measures (Article 10 TFEU). All persons have the right to judicial recourse in cases of direct or indirect discrimination, specifically in cases where they are in comparable situations but being treated differently without an objective and legitimate justification. Victims of discrimination may also seek assistance from national equality bodies, which are public institutions set up across the EU to promote equality and tackle discrimination.

Thus, for a non-legislative act to be adopted, a legislative act must first delegate to the Commission the power to adopt it. The legislative act must also explicitly define the objectives, content, scope and duration of the delegation of power to the Commission. The delegation of power is subject to the following conditions: the European Parliament or the Council may decide to revoke the delegation; the delegated act may enter into force only if no objection has been expressed by the European Parliament or the Council within a deadline set by the legislative act. Some non-legislative acts adopted in the form of regulations, directives or decisions which do not specify to whom they are addressed. In this case, they are signed by the President of the institution which adopted them. Regulations and directives which are addressed to all EU countries, and decisions which do not specify to whom they are addressed, are published in the Official Journal of the European Union. They enter into force on the date specified in them or, if no date is specified, on the 20th day following that of their publication.

These procedures are often given the acronym 'NLE' (non-legislative enactment). Besides legal acts adopted under the ordinary or special legislative procedures, which are legislative acts, many non-legislative acts are adopted by the European Commission or the Council of the European Union. Many of these non-legislative acts are delegated acts (Article 290 of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union – TFEU), where the Commission or the Council has been empowered to adopt legal acts that supplement or amend non-essential parts of the legislative act. The legislative acts define the objectives, content, scope and duration of such delegations of power. There are also implementing acts (Article 291 TFEU) where, as a general rule, having consulted a committee in which every EU Member State is represented, the Commission can adopt uniform conditions for the implementation of a legislative act. Implementing and delegated acts may not, however, exceed the framework established in the basic act. Although delegated and implementing acts account for the majority of non-legislative procedures, other examples include: the ratification of certain international agreements negotiated by the EU under Article 218 TFEU; acts adopted in cases of a serious breach of fundamental rights under Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU); the accession of new Member States under Article 49 TEU; arrangements for the withdrawal from the EU under Article 50 TEU; directives adopted through the social protocol procedure under Articles 154 and 155 TFEU.

They come in a wide variety of forms that encompass services such as social media, online marketplaces, app stores, search engines, payment systems, creative content outlets, price comparison websites and platforms for the collaborative (or 'gig') economy.

There are other dangers too, such as illegal or harmful content, where the use of certain platforms has resulted in giving some parties undue influence in elections, or in incitement to terrorism or sexual abuse, or hate speech. To address these issues, as part of a digital services package, the European Union has agreed upon the adoption of two landmark legislative acts that entered into force in autumn 2022: The digital services act, which seeks to ensure: more safety for users (protecting them from illegal/harmful content while preserving their freedom of expression);greater transparency of platforms (explaining why users see what they see on a platform, for example, or why one seller is ranked higher than another); andbetter enforcement (providing for redress and sanctions). The digital markets act, which applies to 'gatekeepers' operating core platform services (for example, online intermediation services, search engines, social networking services, video-sharing platform services), who are potentially capable of creating digital market bottlenecks between businesses and end-users. It seeks to ensure that the role large gatekeepers play does not give them an unfair advantage and that they meet several obligations, including in relation to: the use to which they put the vast amount of data they collect;the need for their solutions to be interoperable, so that competing providers are not excluded from the platform; andadjusting their search algorithms so that rival offers have the same level of prominence as their own offers.

Over time, as technology developed and the value of content circulating through the network increased, ISPs developed the ability to treat information flows differently, prioritising certain high-value monetised traffic (such as streamed films), potentially at the expense of throttling or blocking other non-monetised traffic for end users. Net neutrality aims to keep the connectivity market essentially separate from the content market. European Union (EU) regulation on open internet access gives end users the right to access and distribute lawful content and services of their choosing via their internet access service. It evokes the principle of non-discriminatory traffic management while, at the same time, allowing reasonable exceptions and specialised services by providers, with some safeguards. The three exceptions are: compliance with legal obligations; network integrity; and congestion management in exceptional and temporary situations. Applicable since 2016, Regulation (EU) 2015/2120 is part of the EU's digital strategy. Common EU measures on open internet access ensure that the same rules apply across Europe.

It is a form of intergovernmental policy-making that does not result in binding EU legislative measures and it does not require EU countries to introduce or amend their laws. The OMC, originally created in the 1990s as part of employment policy and the Luxembourg process, was defined as an instrument of the Lisbon strategy (2000). This was a time when EU economic integration was advancing quickly but EU countries were reticent to give more powers to the European institutions. The OMC has provided a new framework for cooperation between the EU countries, whose national policies can thus be directed towards certain common objectives. Under this intergovernmental method, the EU countries are evaluated by one another (peer pressure), with the Commission's role being limited to surveillance. The European Parliament and the Court of Justice play virtually no part in the OMC process. The OMC takes place in areas which fall within the competence of EU countries, such as employment, social protection, education, youth and vocational training. The OMC is principally based on: jointly identifying and defining objectives to be achieved (adopted by the Council); jointly established measuring instruments (statistics, indicators, guidelines); benchmarking, i.e. comparison of EU countries' performance and the exchange of best practices (monitored by the Commission).

As from 2021, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden benefit from such corrections. As part of the adoption of the multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027 and the recovery package, the Council adopted a new own-resources decision (Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/2053) in December 2020. This will raise the maximum amount of resources that can be called from EU countries in any given year to finance EU expenditure — the own-resources ceiling — from 1.20% to 1.40% of the sum of the EU-27 GNI. This reflects the integration of the European Development Fund into the EU budget and addresses the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU, a former net contributor to the budget. Decision (EU, Euratom) 2020/2053 also authorises the Commission, on an exceptional basis, to borrow temporarily up to EUR750 billion in 2018 prices on the capital markets to address the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. In parallel, the own-resources ceiling will be exceptionally and temporarily increased by a further 0.6 percentage points to cover all liabilities of the EU resulting from this borrowing until all the borrowed funds have been repaid. To enter into force, the decision needs to be approved by all 27 EU countries in accordance with their constitutional requirements.

The Paris Agreement is the first worldwide legally binding global climate agreement. It sets out a global framework to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2 degreesC and aiming to limit it to 1.5 degreesC. It also aims to strengthen countries' ability to deal with the impacts of climate change and support them in their efforts. The agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016. The agreement covers a number of aspects including: Climate mitigation: a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2 degreesC above pre-industrial levels; to aim to limit the increase to 1.5 degreesC, since this would significantly reduce risks and the impacts of climate change; to contribute to the Paris Agreement's objectives, each party submits a comprehensive national climate action plan ('nationally determined contribution'). Transparency and global stocktaking of countries' progress towards meeting their commitments. Climate adaptation: strengthening societies' ability to deal with the impacts of climate change; provide continued and enhanced international support for climate adaptation to developing countries. Developed countries will continue to support climate action to reduce emissions and build resilience to climate change impacts in developing countries. Other countries are encouraged to voluntarily provide, or continue to provide, such support. A recognition of the importance of averting, minimising and tackling loss and damage due to the adverse impacts of climate change, and the need to cooperate and enhance the understanding, action and support in different areas, such as early warning systems, emergency preparedness and risk insurance. A recognition of the role of others involved in tackling climate change, who are not parties to the Agreement, including cities and other subnational authorities, civil society organisations, the private sector and others.

On a proposal from its Conference of Presidents, the EP defines their size and powers. Currently, Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) work on 20 standing committees (i.e. permanent committees). These committees deal with subjects ranging from civil liberties, through regional development, to budgetary and financial affairs. A committee consists of between 25 and 81 full members and an equivalent number of substitutes. Each committee elects a chair and up to four vice-chairs amongst its full members, who together form the 'committee bureau', for a mandate of 2.5 years. The political composition of the committees reflects that of the EP as a whole. The EP also sets up special committees to deal with specific topics, for a given period. In 2021, there are three special committees: beating cancer, foreign interference in all democratic processes in the European Union, including disinformation, artificial intelligence in a digital age. The EP may also set up committees of inquiry to investigate breaches of EU law or alleged maladministration in the application of EU law. The powers of these committees are based on the rules governing the exercise of the EP's right of inquiry. Currently, there is one committee of inquiry — on the protection of animals during transport. The EP can also set up subcommittees. The EP's Foreign Affairs Committee has subcommittees dealing with human rights and security and defence, while the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee has a subcommittee on tax matters. Committee membership: the EP's political groups and MEPs who do not belong to a political group appoint the members to different committees at the beginning of a parliamentary term. The committees produce reports that are drafted by a 'rapporteur': legislative reports, proposing amendments to a draft legislation proposal from the European Commission; non-legislative reports; own-initiative reports. Committees meet when convened by their Chair or at the request of the President of the EP. The Council and the Commission are allowed to take part in meetings, if invited to do so. Parliamentary committees conduct hearings of Commissioners-designate in their specialised areas prior to the EP's confirmation of a new European Commission.

The use of a passerelle clause means there is no need to formally amend the EU treaties and thus no requirement for this to be ratified by the EU Member States. General passerelle clauses The first type of general passerelle clause is where the decision-making is changed from unanimity to qualified majority voting in the Council of the European Union. It applies in the case of legislative proposals where the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) or Title V of the TEU (which concerns the EU's external action and common foreign and security policy) specify that the Council should act by unanimity. It should be noted that decisions with military implications and in the defence field are excluded. The second instance of a general passerelle clause is where legislative acts are required by the TFEU to be adopted under the special legislative procedure, with the Council as the sole legislator, and the European Parliament is either consulted or asked for its consent. Here the passerelle clause would result in a switch from the special legislative procedure to the ordinary legislative procedure (formerly known as co-decision). The EU's areas of jurisdiction are not changed in either of these cases. Upon receiving notification from the European Council that the use of a general passerelle clause is being proposed, national parliaments have 6 months to register their veto. In addition, a majority of the Parliament's component members must give their consent to the use of the passerelle clause. Only then may the European Council approve by unanimity either type of passerelle clause. Specific passerelle clauses The EU treaties also provide for passerelle clauses which apply to six specific policy areas. These six special passerelle clauses apply in the fields of: 1.common foreign and security policy (Article 31(3) TEU); 2.family law with cross-border implications (Article 81(3)TFEU); 3.social policy (Article 153(2) TFEU); 4.environmental policy (Article 192(2) TFEU); 5.the multiannual financial framework (Article 312(2) TFEU); and 6.enhanced cooperation (Article 333 TFEU). The conditions for adopting legislation in these areas require a less elaborate procedure if the institutions decide to apply a passerelle clause. In the first four cases, it is the Council that decides about the passerelle clauses, while in the last two it is the European Council.

In order to do this, interested countries must fulfil two main conditions provided in Protocol No 10 annexed to the treaty: They must intensively develop defence capacities through the development of national contributions and their participation in multinational forces, in the main European equipment programmes and in the activities of the European Defence Agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments; They must have the capacity by 2010 to supply combat units and support logistics for the tasks referred to in Article 43 TEU within a period of 5 to 30 days and, depending on needs, for a period of 30 to 120 days. The European Defence Agency regularly assesses the contributions of participating countries. EU countries wishing to constitute permanent structured cooperation must notify their intention to the Council and to the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Following this notification, the Council must adopt a decision by qualified majority establishing permanent structured cooperation and the list of participating countries. The membership of new countries or the suspension of some of them is decided by the Council by a qualified majority of the members participating in the permanent structured cooperation. The decisions and recommendations taken within the framework of such permanent structured cooperation are adopted by unanimity of the participating Council members only.

PESCO is designed to: enhance the EU's capabilities in international security; contribute to protecting EU citizens; maximise the effectiveness of defence spending. While participation is voluntary, decision-making remains in the hands of individual Member States and the specific character of their security and defence policies is taken into account.

The Parliament's Committee on Petitions, which does its work on behalf of EU citizens and residents, considers whether such requests are admissible. Where it sees fit, it may refer a question to the Ombudsman. When drawing up an opinion on a petition deemed to be admissible, it may ask the European Commission for documents or information. It can also send the petition to other parliamentary committees for information purposes in order for them to take action.

It is dealt with in Title V of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (Chapters I, IV and V). EU police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters takes three forms: cooperation between national police forces; cooperation between national administrations (in particular customs services); cooperation between national judicial authorities. Cooperation is implemented with the help of EU agencies such as the European Union Agency for Criminal Justice Cooperation (Eurojust), the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol) and the European Judicial Network. Cooperation between the judiciary mainly operates through a mechanism known as mutual recognition of judgments and judicial decisions (e.g. in the area of detention and transfer of prisoners, the European Arrest Warrant, the European Investigation Order, the confiscation and freezing of assets, and financial penalties). In June 2022, the Council of the European Union adopted a recommendation on operational police cooperation. This sets out a series of standards for operational cooperation between police officers operating in another EU Member State or participating in joint operations. These include: a series of principles for cross-border hot pursuits and surveillance; a list of offences for which cross-border hot pursuit and surveillance should be allowed; a framework for joint operations; the introduction of a support platform for joint patrols and other joint operations, and ensuring effective access to information and communication through secure channels; joint training and professional development with a view to setting up a European police culture.

If this were not the case, Member States could simply allow their national laws to take precedence over primary or secondary EU legislation, and the pursuit of EU policies would become unworkable. The principle of the primacy of EU law has developed over time by means of the case law (jurisprudence) of the Court of Justice of the European Union. It is not enshrined in the EU treaties, although there is a brief declaration annexed to the Treaty of Lisbon in regard to it. In Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen (Case 26/62), the Court declared that the laws adopted by EU institutions were capable of creating legal rights which could be enforced by both natural and legal persons before the courts of the Member States. EU law therefore has direct effect. In Costa v ENEL (Case 6/64), the Court further built on the principle of direct effect and captured the idea that the aims of the treaties would be undermined if EU law could be made subordinate to national law. As the Member States transferred certain powers to the EU, they limited their sovereign rights, and thus in order for EU norms to be effective they must take precedence over any provision of national law, including constitutions. Further examples of cases in which the Court affirmed the primacy of EU law include: Internationale Handelsgesellschaft mbH v Einfuhr- und Vorratsstelle fur Getreide und Futtermittel (Case 11/70); Amministrazione delle Finanze dello Stato v Simmenthal SpA (Case 106/77); Marleasing SA v La Comercial Internacional de Alimentacion SA (Case C-106/89). In these cases, the Court clarified that the primacy of EU law must be applied to all national acts, whether they were adopted before or after the EU act in question. Where EU law takes precedence over conflicting national law, the national provisions are not automatically annulled or invalidated. However, national authorities and courts must refuse to apply those provisions as long as the overriding EU norms are in force. The principle of primacy therefore seeks to ensure that people are uniformly protected by an EU law across all EU territories. It should be noted that the primacy of EU law only applies where Member States have ceded sovereignty to the EU – in fields such as the single market, environment, transport, etc. However, it does not apply in areas such as education, culture or tourism.

It is closely linked to the principle of subsidiarity, which requires that the EU take action only if it is more effective than action taken at the national, regional or local level. Another related principle, the principle of conferral, states that any policy areas not explicitly agreed on in the treaties by all Member States remain in their domain. The criteria for applying the principle are set out in the protocol (No 2) on the application of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality annexed to the treaties.

It aims to ensure that decisions are taken at the closest possible level to the citizen and that constant checks are made to verify that action at the European Union (EU) level is justified in light of the possibilities available at the national, regional or local level. Specifically, it is the principle whereby the EU does not take action (except in the areas that fall within its exclusive jurisdiction), unless it is more effective than action taken at the national, regional or local level. It is closely linked to the principle of proportionality, which requires that any action taken by the EU not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the aims of the treaties. Another related principle, the principle of conferral, states that any policy areas not explicitly agreed in the treaties by all EU Member States remain in their domain. There are two relevant protocols annexed to the Treaty of Lisbon: Protocol No 1 on the role of national parliaments encourages national parliaments' involvement in EU activities, and requires EU documents and proposals to be forwarded promptly to them so they can examine them before the Council of the European Union makes a decision. Protocol No 2 requires the European Commission to take into account the regional and local dimension of all draft legislative acts and to make a detailed statement on how the principle of subsidiarity is respected. This protocol allows national parliaments to object to a proposal on the grounds that it breaches the principle, as a result of which the proposal must be reviewed and may be maintained, amended or withdrawn by the Commission or blocked by the European Parliament or the Council. In the event of a breach of the principle of subsidiarity, the European Committee of the Regions or Member States may refer an adopted act directly to the Court of Justice of the European Union.

Once ratification has been completed, an agreement can be concluded and formally enters into force (note: often, an agreement may apply provisionally prior to the completion of the ratification procedure). Procedures for the ratification of international agreements negotiated by the European Commission on the EU's behalf are laid down in Article 218 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). These agreements cover a wide range of issues including trade (Article 207 of the TFEU); scientific and technological cooperation (Article 186 of the TFEU); visa waivers (Article 77(2) of the TFEU); climate action (Article 192 of the TFEU). There are also specific treaty articles dealing with agreements with countries wishing to join (Article 49 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU)); or withdraw from the EU (Article 50 of the TEU). Article 47 of the TEU endows the EU with legal personality. This means that it has the power to negotiate and conclude international agreements under Article 5 TEU (which defines the limits of EU competences); and Articles 2 (distribution of competences), 3 (exclusive competences) and 4 (shared competences) of the TFEU. Where an international agreement falls under exclusive EU competence, there is no need for EU countries to ratify it. In this case, its ratification requires the European Parliament's consent before the Council can finally conclude the agreement. Where an agreement falls within shared (also known as 'concurrent') competence between the EU and the EU countries (a so-called 'mixed' agreement), it needs to be ratified both at EU level and at EU country level by national parliaments. Ratification at national level depends on aspects such as whether EU countries have 1 or 2 houses of parliament; or a federal system, which might also require agreement at subnational level — by states (such as Länder in Germany and Austria) or regions (in Belgium).

They have general application, are binding in their entirety and are directly applicable in all European Union (EU) Member States. A regulation is part of the EU's secondary law, the body of law that derives from the principles and objectives set out in the EU treaties (primary law). A regulation is addressed to abstract categories of persons, not to identified persons. This is what distinguishes it from a decision, defined in Article 288 of the TFEU. It is binding in its entirety. A regulation must be complied with fully by those to whom it applies. It is a legal act binding upon: the EU institutions, Member States, the individuals to whom it applies. A regulation is directly applicable in all Member States. This means that it: applies immediately as the norm in all Member States, without needing to be transposed into national law; creates rights and obligations for individuals, and they can therefore invoke it directly before national courts; can be used as a reference by individuals in their relationship with other individuals, Member States or EU authorities. A regulation is applicable in all Member States from the date of its entry into force (a date that it sets or, failing that, 20 days after its publication in the EU's Official Journal). Its legal effects are simultaneously, automatically and uniformly binding in all the national legislations. Under Article 290 TFEU, the European Commission may adopt delegated regulations to specify or complement certain details or aspects of a regulation or an EU directive. Under Article 291 TFEU, the European Parliament and the Council may authorise the Commission to adopt regulations to ensure that legislation is implemented in the same way throughout the EU.

Over the years, the policy has evolved significantly, particularly since 1984 when the first multiannual European framework programme (FP) for research was launched. The first FPs had the modest aim of supporting cross-border cooperation in pre-competitive research and development (R & D conducted jointly by usually competing organisations for the purpose of developing new commercially applicable technologies from which they could each benefit). The 9th and latest FP, Horizon Europe, which will run for the 2021-2027 period, is now the world's largest research and innovation programme. In line with Article 182(3) TFEU, the FP is implemented through specific programmes (SPs) that define the detailed rules for carrying out the FP within each activity, fix its duration and set a budget for its implementation. In addition to seeking to boost EU competitiveness, EU research programmes promote collaboration and inclusion by: involving a variety of types of organisations, ranging from research institutes, industry, small and medium-sized enterprises and academia, as well as individuals, from a geographical spread of countries (EU and non-EU countries); and building RDT capacity in less-advanced regions as part of the EU's structural and cohesion policy to remove disparities between regions.

These measures are not punitive and are imposed to bring about a change in policy or activity by the target party (or parties) responsible for the behaviour that is at issue (e.g. not respecting international law or human rights, or pursuing policies or actions that do not conform with the rule of law or democratic principles). The measures must be consistent with the objectives of the EU's external action, as laid down in Article 21 TEU. Under Article 29 TEU, the Council takes decisions to adopt, renew or lift sanctions regimes by unanimity, on the basis of proposals from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The economic and financial aspects of such decisions (e.g. import/export restrictions and freezing of assets) are implemented by regulations adopted by the Council on the basis of Article 215 TFEU (qualified majority), upon a joint proposal by the High Representative and the European Commission. EU sanctions may be imposed either in implementation of measures to implement United Nations Security Council resolutions or on an autonomous basis, i.e. on the EU's own initiative. Restrictive measures may include: prohibitions on the export of arms and related equipment restrictions on admission (visa/travel bans) economic measures such as restrictions on imports and exports freezing of funds and economic resources owned by targeted individuals or entities. The Commission is responsible for ensuring, through monitoring, that the regulations imposing restrictive measures adopted under Article 215 TFEU are implemented and enforced by the Member States. It also supports individuals, businesses, humanitarian operators and Member States in their efforts to apply sanctions, by publishing guidance notes and answering questions of interpretation raised by national competent authorities.

Regulation (EU) 2022/612 extends and improves roaming services with additional benefits. Individuals will have more information about potential charges from calling value-added services (such as helpdesks, insurance companies or airlines). They will also be better protected from inadvertent and excessive charges. The legislation also: regulates roaming service conditions and wholesale access to public mobile communications networks; increases transparency and improves access to information on charges; increases transparency for users of non-regulated roaming services, such as on board ships or aircraft; improves mobile internet quality by ensuring consumers have access to faster networks abroad, just as they do at home. Mobile network operators must meet all reasonable requests for wholesale roaming access, in particular in a manner that allows the roaming provider to replicate the retail mobile services offered domestically where it is technically feasible to do so on the visited network. Mobile network operators may refuse requests for wholesale roaming access only on the basis of objective criteria such as technical feasibility and network integrity. Commercial considerations are not grounds for refusing requests for wholesale roaming access in order to limit the provision of competing roaming services.

Respect for the rule of law is essential for the very functioning of the EU: for the effective application of EU law, for the proper functioning of the internal market, for maintaining an investment-friendly environment and for mutual trust. The EU has developed a number of different instruments to promote and uphold the rule of law. The EU's rule-of-law policy approach rests on three pillars: the promotion of a rule-of-law culture in the EU, which involves deepening common work to spread understanding of the rule of law in Europe; the prevention of rule-of-law problems where they emerge in a Member State, having the capacity to intervene at an early stage and avoiding the risk of escalation, including in particular the European Rule of Law Mechanism, with the annual Rule of Law Report at its centre; the ability to mount an effective response when a problem of sufficient significance has been identified in a Member State, including the procedure under Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union. Along with having a functional democracy and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities, the rule of law is also one of the political criteria that countries wishing to join the EU have to meet.

It seeks to help the EU's rural areas address the economic, environmental and social challenges that they face. It has three long-term objectives: to foster the competitiveness of agriculture and forestry; to manage natural resources sustainably and implement climate action measures; to achieve balanced territorial development in rural areas, including creating and maintaining jobs. EU funding available for rural development is available from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD). The EAFRD budget for the 2021-2027 period amounts to EUR95.5 billion, which includes an injection of EUR8.1 billion from the next generation EU recovery instrument to help address the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The policy is implemented by means of 7-year rural development programmes drawn up in partnership with the EU. These focus on the following six priorities: knowledge transfer and innovation; competitiveness of all types of farming and sustainable management of forests; promoting food chain organisation; restoring, preserving and enhancing ecosystems; promoting resource efficiency and the transition to a low-carbon economy; promoting social inclusion, poverty reduction and economic development in rural areas. The principles, rules and standards for the implementation of the EAFRD, as for the other European Structural and Investment Funds, are laid down in Regulation (EU) No 1303/2013. The rules for rural development spending during 2021-2022 are laid out in the common agricultural policy transitional regulation, adopted on 23 December 2020. The regulation largely extends the existing rules (initially in place for the 2014-2020 period), with some additional elements to ensure a smooth transition to the future CAP legislation, set to begin in 2023.

These measures are not punitive and are imposed to bring about a change in policy or activity by the target party (or parties) responsible for the behaviour that is at issue (e.g. not respecting international law or human rights, or pursuing policies or actions that do not conform with the rule of law or democratic principles). The measures must be consistent with the objectives of the EU's external action, as laid down in Article 21 TEU. Under Article 29 TEU, the Council takes decisions to adopt, renew or lift sanctions regimes by unanimity, on the basis of proposals from the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. The economic and financial aspects of such decisions (e.g. import/export restrictions and freezing of assets) are implemented by regulations adopted by the Council on the basis of Article 215 TFEU (qualified majority), upon a joint proposal by the High Representative and the European Commission. EU sanctions may be imposed either in implementation of measures to implement United Nations Security Council resolutions or on an autonomous basis, i.e. on the EU's own initiative. Sanctions may include: prohibitions on the export of arms and related equipment restrictions on admission (visa/travel bans) economic measures such as restrictions on imports and exports freezing of funds and economic resources owned by targeted individuals or entities. The Commission is responsible for ensuring, through monitoring, that the regulations imposing restrictive measures adopted under Article 215 TFEU are implemented and enforced by the Member States. It also supports individuals, businesses, humanitarian operators and Member States in their efforts to apply sanctions, by publishing guidance notes and answering questions of interpretation raised by national competent authorities.

The Treaty of Lisbon made an 'area ... without internal frontiers, in which the free movement of persons is ensured' an EU goal. Today 27 European countries, including 23 of the 27 Member States and the four European Free Trade Association countries – Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland – are part of the Schengen area. Since 1 January 2023, checks on people at internal land and sea borders between Croatia and the other countries of the Schengen area have been lifted and the Schengen acquis has fully applied to Croatia (Council Decision (EU) 2022/2451). Checks at internal air borders will be lifted from 26 March 2023, given the need for this to coincide with the dates of the International Air Transport Association's summer/winter time schedule. Since 31 March 2024, the provisions of the Schengen acquis have fully applied to Bulgaria and Romania, and the checks at internal air and sea borders have been lifted. The Council of the European Union, at a later date, is to take a decision, acting by unanimity, lifting checks on people at internal land borders with Greece, Hungary and between Bulgaria and Romania. Cyprus, in accordance with its act of accession, will soon be part of the Schengen area. Ireland is the only Member State that is not part of the Schengen area. Although it participates in Schengen police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, it is not part of the area without internal border controls and maintains border controls with the Schengen countries.

Furthermore, it is binding only for certain matters such as State aid and the implementation of structural funds or other EU programmes. There are various EU programmes supporting work on SME-related issues, in particular the single market programme.

Within this programme, there is a specific budget (EUR1 billion) available for projects and activities related to SMEs. The main objective is to help tackle the key challenges these businesses are facing in terms of competitiveness and sustainability. Activities supported under the SME component of this programme also focus on goals such as promoting entrepreneurship, new business opportunities (including access to markets), strengthening the competitiveness of the industrial ecosystems and developing industrial value chains. Projects and activities supported under the SME component of this programme are generally implemented by support providers and other bodies involved in cooperation with SMEs. Some of these projects also provide third-party finance to SMEs involved in designing, testing and implementing solutions or services. The single market programme and its SME component are not an investment programme. Other EU instruments such as InvestEU and the structural funds will provide support for business investments.

Their activities range from trade unions, culture and recycling to health and care-related services. The social economy contributes to the implementation of the United Nations sustainable development goals by: reducing poverty; driving the transition to sustainable cities and communities; promoting responsible consumption and production; and championing sustainable finance. In late 2021, to help the sector reach its full potential, the European Commission adopted a social economy action plan focused on three aspects: creating the right conditions for the social economy to thrive; opening opportunities for social economy organisations to start up and scale up; and making sure the social economy and its potential are recognised. At the same time, the Commission launched a 'transition pathway' to help enable the green and digital transitions of the social economy, working together with public authorities and other interested parties.

In addition, Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) gives binding force to the social rights in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. A horizontal social clause is introduced by Article 9 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. The definition and implementation of the EU's policies and actions must take into account the following social requirements: the promotion of a high level of employment; the guarantee of adequate social protection; the fight against social exclusion; a high level of education, training and protection of human health. Social policy is primarily the responsibility of EU countries. However, certain aspects are a shared competence with the EU. The European Parliament and the Council may adopt incentive measures to support and complement the actions of EU countries in certain areas, such as the fight against social exclusion. They may also adopt minimum requirements in the form of directives, namely legislation which enables EU countries to adopt additional stricter provisions. These directives only concern: health and safety of workers; working conditions; social security and social protection of workers (EU countries remain responsible for defining the fundamental principles of their social security systems); protection of workers in the case of termination of their employment contract; information and protection of workers; collective representation and defence of workers' and employers' interests; working conditions for non-EU nationals residing legally on EU territory; integration of persons excluded from the labour market; equality between men and women concerning their treatment in relation to employment.

It was designed to ensure that EU Member States maintained sound public finances after the single currency was introduced. In formal terms, the pact originally comprised a European Council resolution (adopted in 1997) and two Council regulations of 7 July 1997 laying down detailed technical arrangements (one on the surveillance of budgetary positions and the coordination of economic policies and the other on implementing the excessive deficit procedure). Following discussions on the SGP's operation, the regulations were amended in 2005. However, enforcement was weak, resulting in serious fiscal imbalances in some Member States, which became exposed when the economic and financial crisis struck in 2008. Since the crisis, the EU's economic governance rules have been strengthened by means of eight EU regulations and one international treaty: the six-pack (which introduced a system to monitor broader economic policies, so as to detect problems like real estate bubbles or falling competitiveness early on); the two-pack (a new cycle of monitoring for the euro area, with countries – except those with macroeconomic adjustment programmes – submitting their draft budgetary plans to the European Commission every autumn); the 2012 Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (fiscal compact) which introduced stricter fiscal provisions than the SGP. This set of measures is now an integral part of the European semester, the EU's economic policy coordination mechanism. In January 2015, following a review, the Commission issued detailed guidance on how it will apply the existing SGP rules so as to strengthen the link between structural reforms, investment (particularly in view of the recently created European Fund for Strategic Investments) and fiscal responsibility in support of jobs and growth. In February 2020, the Commission published a review that aimed to assess the effectiveness of the current framework for economic and fiscal surveillance, especially the six-pack and two-pack reforms, and launched a public debate. In November 2022, the Commission came forward with its orientations (guidelines) for a reform of the economic governance framework, which proposed a wide-ranging reform of the design and operation of the SGP.

They ensure that products and services are interoperable with one another, are safe to use and will not harm people's health or the environment. They generate confidence that a product or service is fit for purpose and allow businesses to compete throughout the EU and globally. Standards also have a key role to play in enabling innovation: they provide a common framework on which to build by setting out the essential characteristics of a product or service and defining common vocabularies. For goods and services subject to EU harmonisation legislation, European standards are developed by the European standardisation bodies (the European Committee for Standardisation, the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation and the European Telecommunication Standards Institute), which, on the request of the European Commission, draw up technical specifications. Industry plays an important role in this consensus-building process, as do the national standardisation bodies of EU Member States and of the European Free Trade Association countries, representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises, public authorities and representatives of consumer, trade union and environmental interests. As a rule, businesses are not obliged to use European standards; they may choose another technical solution to demonstrate their products' compliance with mandatory legal requirements. Nevertheless, compliance with a harmonised standard allows them to demonstrate more easily that their products comply with EU legislation. The list of harmonised standards is regularly updated and published in the Official Journal of the European Union. For goods that are not, or are only partly, subject to EU harmonisation legislation, the principle of mutual recognition applies. This guarantees that any good lawfully sold in one Member State can be sold in another. This is possible even if the good does not fully comply with the technical rules of the other Member State (although there may be exceptions where public safety, health or the environment are concerned). In February 2022, the Commission presented a new EU standardisation strategy designed to: strengthen the EU's global competitiveness; ensure that new technologies reflect its democratic values; and enable its transition towards a climate-neutral, resilient and circular economy. Where global standards exist, the European standardisation organisations mentioned above seek to align European standards as much as possible with the international standards adopted by the recognised international standardisation organisations (the International Organization for Standardization, the International Electrotechnical Commission and the International Telecommunication Union). Besides European and international standards, EU legislation can also contain references to national standards developed by the national standardisation bodies of EU Member States or references to technical specifications other than those developed by standard-development organisations. The legal effect of all these referenced standards and technical specifications depends on the legal nature of the reference.

This was revised in 2006 providing a long-term vision for sustainability in which economic growth, social cohesion and environmental protection go hand in hand and are mutually supporting. The European Commissions review of the strategy in 2009 highlighted the persistence of some unsustainable trends and the need for greater efforts in their regard.

It seeks to reconcile promoting economic prosperity with social inclusion and environmental stewardship, and serves as a basis for all European Union (EU) policies and initiatives. Sustainable development is formally one of the EU's long-term goals under Article 3(3) of the Treaty on European Union. The EU is committed to achieving the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in September 2015. The EU has various policies, strategies and initiatives in place to meet challenges such as tackling climate change, transitioning to a low-carbon economy, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship, and promoting equal opportunities, access to jobs, education and healthcare, and social protection. These include the European Green Deal, the European semester, the circular economy action plan, the environment action programme, the better regulation agenda, the EU cohesion policy and the European Pillar of Social Rights action plan. In 2023, the EU published and presented at the UN its first-ever voluntary review on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Beyond its borders, the EU recognises the links between global challenges and the importance of international cooperation. It played a leading role in shaping the global 2030 Agenda and the SDGs, and is actively involved in forums and initiatives to address challenges such as poverty, hunger, health, education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation. In 2017, the EU adopted the European Consensus on Development, which sets out its policy on development cooperation, and, in 2021, it adopted the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument – Global Europe, its most recent development cooperation instrument. By means of its trade policy, the EU seeks to promote sustainable development in the trade agreements that it signs with partner countries. Eurostat, the EU's statistics office, along with the European Commission, other EU agencies, EU Member States and other stakeholders, has developed a series of indicators to track the EU's progress in meeting the SDGs. The Sustainable Development in the European Union'report, published annually by Eurostat, compiles and reviews trends in these indicators, allowing EU policies to be evaluated and, where appropriate, adapted.

Indeed, since the 1990s, sustainable development has been enshrined in the EU treaties as one of the EU's long-term goals and a priority for both its external (for example, development cooperation and trade) and internal policies (for example, environment, social exclusion and discrimination). The references to sustainable development as an EU goal are currently found under Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union. Sustainable development priorities have been mainstreamed into the EU's key cross-cutting agendas as well as into sectoral policies and initiatives. In signing up to the 2030 Agenda, the international community undertook to address the global challenges of: eradicating poverty; finding sustainable and inclusive development solutions; ensuring human rights for all; and making sure that no one is left behind. The 17 SDGs build upon the UN's Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which ran over the period from 2000 to 2015. While the MDGs focussed on developing countries only, the SDGs apply to all countries. The SDGs balance the economic, social and environmental facets of sustainability and define 169 associated targets to be achieved by 2030. The following is a list of the SDGs: no poverty; zero hunger; good health and well-being; quality education; gender equality; clean water and sanitation; affordable and clean energy; decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure; reduced inequalities; sustainable cities and communities; responsible consumption and production; climate action; life below water; life on land; peace, justice and strong institutions; and partnerships for the goals. Since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, the EU has taken a broad range of actions to implement the SDGs. With the von der Leyen Commission, the SDGs have been highlighted in a range of major deliverables and landmarks documents — such as the President's Political Guidelines, the Mission Letters of Commissioners, Commission Work Programmes putting SDGs at the heart of EU policy, the European Green Deal, the refocusing of the European Semester, a dedicated Staff Working Document ('Delivering on the UN's Sustainable Development Goals — A comprehensive approach') and the active integration of SDGs in Better Regulation. Eurostat monitors progress in achieving the SDGs and publishes annual reports. Externally, the implementation of the SDGs is a central part of the EU commitment to multilateralism. The 2017 European Consensus on Development contains a shared commitment by all EU institutions and Member States to support partner countries in implementing the SDGs. This is being taken further, together with the pursuit of EU priorities, in particular in the support of a sustainable recovery aligned with the SDGs through our new programming and Team Europe.

Tax measures at the level of the EU can also be adopted to support the environmental and energy policies (Articles 192 and 194 respectively of the TFEU). The European Commission does not consider that across-the-board harmonisation of EU countries tax systems is necessary to the extent that the establishment and functioning of the internal market is not hampered; countries should be able to choose what they consider to be the most appropriate system for themselves. According to the principle of subsidiarity, there should only be action at EU level where action at individual country level does not yield an effective solution, but can be better achieved at EU level. EU harmonisation efforts predominantly focus on legislation on taxes levied on goods and services (indirect taxes, such as value-added tax (VAT), excise duties levied on energy products, electricity, alcohol and manufactured tobacco) rather than taxes on incomes or profits (direct taxes).

The main focus of EU tax policy is the smooth operation of its single market, i.e. ensuring that cross-border economic activity is not impeded by tax barriers and that distortions of competition are avoided. It seeks to ensure that citizens and businesses do not experience difficulties in regard to double taxation, distortion of competition, claiming tax refunds and obtaining information on tax rules in relation to other EU countries. EU harmonisation efforts have predominantly concentrated on legislation on taxes levied on goods and services (indirect taxes, such as value-added tax ( VAT) and excise duties levied on energy products, electricity, alcohol and manufactured tobacco) rather than taxes on incomes or profits (direct taxes). Nevertheless, some progress has been made on measures to deal with tax evasion on savings and mutual assistance between tax administrations. Specific provisions regarding taxation are laid down in Articles 110 to 113 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. The adoption of harmonised legislation on taxation requires the unanimous agreement of all EU countries in the Council – a factor that has tended to act as a brake on the adoption of common rules. As a result, recently, a group of 11 EU countries has been authorised to establish enhanced cooperation among themselves in the area of financial transaction tax and more use is now being made of non-binding approaches, like recommendations, as a means of achieving coordination in the tax field.", "Related": [], "Referenced Source": "EUR Lex Glossary", "Synonym": null}

TENs are essential to the proper operation of the European Union's (EU) single market and to employment, since they ensure the free movement of goods, persons and services. Articles 170, 171 and 172 together with Article 194 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provide the legal basis for TENs, which exist in the following three sectors of activity. Trans-European transport networks (TEN-T) cover projects of common interest to create new transport infrastructure or to upgrade the existing infrastructure, to close gaps, to remove bottlenecks and to eliminate technical barriers to transport flows between EU Member States. Trans-European energy networks (TEN-E) cover the electricity and natural gas sectors. They aim to link the energy infrastructure of EU Member States to help create a single energy market and contribute to security of supply. Trans-European telecommunications networks (eTEN) aim to remove digital barriers hindering the completion of the digital single market and to achieve the EU's objectives of connecting all European households to the internet. The Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), a fund originally created for the 2014-2020 period to stimulate investment in the TENs and to leverage funding from both the private and public sectors, has been extended for the 2021-2027 multiannual financial framework period. The amounts allocated to the programme from the EU budget are as follows. Transport. EUR11.4 billion (plus a transfer of EUR10 billion from the Cohesion Fund), of which EUR1.4 billion is for the missing major cross-border railway links between cohesion countries. Energy. EUR5.2 billion. Digital. EUR1.8 billion. Directive (EU) 2021/1187 streamlines measures for advancing the realisation of the trans-European transport network by harmonising permit-granting procedures required to implement certain projects. The new 'smart TEN-T' rules clarify the procedures which project promoters need to follow as regards permit granting and public procurement for cross-border projects. The directive covers projects that are part of pre-identified sections of the TEN-T core network. It also covers other projects on the core network corridors, the total cost of which is in excess of EUR300 million. Projects exclusively related to telematics and other new technologies are not covered by the directive, as their deployment is not limited to the TEN-T core network. Member States, however, may apply the directive to other projects on the core and comprehensive TEN-T network as part of a broader, more harmonised approach to transport infrastructure projects.

However,passerelle clauses, which allow exceptions to the legislative procedures initially provided for by the treaties, provide for procedures which allow unanimity voting to be replaced by qualified majority voting, or to change decision-making procedures applicable to specific areas. For example, passerelle clauses may empower the European Council, acting by unanimity, to authorise the Council to act by a qualified majority, see: Article 48(7) of the Treaty on European Union — TEU; Article 31(3) TEU (CFSP); Article 312(2) of the Treaty on the functioning of the EU — TFEU (Multiannual annual financial framework — MFF). Furthermore, passerelle clauses may empower the Council of the European Union, acting by unanimity, to decide, after consulting the European Parliament, to make the ordinary legislative procedure applicable to specific matters, for example: Article 81(3) TFEU (family law with cross-border implications); Article 153(2) TFEU (Social policy); Article 192(2) TFEU (Environmental policy).

Article 14 of the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights grants everyone the right to education and to have access to vocational and continuing training. Article 166 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union recognises that EU countries are responsible for the content and organisation of national VET and that the EU's role is to complement their actions. EU policy thus seeks to address common challenges such as ageing, skills deficits and global competition, with the goal of improving employability and skills. As underscored in the Council recommendation of 24 November 2020, VET has a pivotal role to contribute to sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience for the preparation of young people to successfully enter working life and for the upskilling and reskilling needs of the working-age population, to empower everyone with the knowledge, skills and attitudes to thrive in their professional, social and personal development. The Erasmus programme for 2021-2027, managed by the European Commission, the European Education and Culture Executive Agency and the Erasmus+ national agencies, aims to improve the quality of VET across the EU and offers opportunities for placements and professional development abroad. It also encourages partnerships between VET organisations and businesses and other stakeholders. Other EU bodies active in the field of training are: the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training (Cedefop), in Thessaloniki (set up in 1975); the European Training Foundation, in Turin (set up in 1993 and operational from 1994); the Advisory Committee on Vocational Training, set up to assist the Commission in carrying out its policy; the meetings of the directors-general on VET, composed of high-level representatives from the ministries in charge of VET in 35 countries.

Measures, taken before a substance, material or product has become waste, that reduce: the quantity of waste, including through the reuse of products or the extension of the life span of products;the adverse impacts of the generated waste on the environment and human health; orthe content of harmful substances in materials and products. Preparing for reuse. Checking, cleaning or repairing recovery operations, by which products or components of products that have become waste are prepared so that they can be reused without any other preprocessing. Recycling. Any recovery operation by which waste materials are reprocessed into products, materials or substances, whether for the original or other purposes. It includes the reprocessing of organic material (e.g. composting) but does not include energy recovery and reprocessing into materials that are to be used as fuels or for backfilling operations. Other recovery (e.g. energy recovery). Any other operation the principal result of which is waste serving a useful purpose by replacing other materials that would otherwise have been used to fulfil a particular function, or waste being prepared to fulfil that function, in the plant or in the wider economy.

Until 1 November 2014, the Member States with the largest populations had 27 to 29 votes, medium-sized countries 7 to 14 votes and small countries 3 or 4 votes. A decision required at least 260 out of 352 votes to be adopted. On 1 November 2014, the rules for establishing a qualified majority changed (Article 16 TEU). When the Council acts on a proposal from the Commission or the EU's High Representative, a qualified majority is reached if: 55% of the members of the Council vote in favour (i.e. 15 out of 27); these members of the Council represent at least 65% of the total EU population. This is known as the double majority rule. A blocking minority must include at least 4 Member States. When the Council does not act on a proposal from the Commission or the High Representative a qualified majority is reached if: at least 72% of Council members vote in favour (i.e. 20 out of 27); and they represent at least 65% of the total EU population. Until 31 March 2017, Member States could still request that an act is adopted in accordance with the previous rule for qualified majority voting. In addition, they may request the application of the Ioannina II compromise (see Declaration No 7 annexed to the Lisbon Treaty). This allows a group of countries to demonstrate their opposition to an act even if the group is not large enough in number to constitute a blocking minority.

Under Article 165(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), EU action in this field aims at 'encouraging the development of youth exchanges and of exchanges of socio-educational instructors, and encouraging the participation of young people in democratic life in Europe'. Article 166 TFEU entrusts the EU with the task of facilitating access to vocational training and encouraging the mobility of instructors and trainees, particularly young people. Member States have cooperated in the youth field since 2002. The current framework, the EU youth strategy (2019-2027), seeks to foster youth participation in democratic life and also supports social and civic engagement with the aim of ensuring that all young people have the necessary resources to take part in society. The strategy focuses on three core areas of action, based around three words — engage, connect, empower — while working on joined-up implementation across sectors. It has 11 goals, which identify cross-sectoral areas that affect young people's lives and relate to challenges they may face: connecting EU with youth; equality of all genders; inclusive societies; information and constructive dialogue; mental health and well being; moving rural youth forward; quality employment for all; quality learning; space and participation for all; sustainable green Europe; youth organisations and European programmes. The EU funds a series of programmes offering opportunities to young people, such as Erasmus+ (including DiscoverEU), the European Solidarity Corps and Erasmus+ virtual exchange. These help young people expand their horizons and build bridges across Europe and beyond. Further information is available from the European Youth Portal, which shares EU and national information and opportunities that are of interest to young people. In 2013, the EU launched the youth guarantee — a scheme to ensure that young people receive a good-quality offer of employment, further education or training within 4 months of becoming unemployed or leaving formal education. The youth guarantee was renewed in 2020 and is underpinned by the EU youth employment initiative, which runs until 2023, when the initiative will become part of the European Social Fund.

Pollution causes one in eight deaths in Europe each year and is a factor in a variety of medical conditions. It is one of the five main drivers of biodiversity loss and is threatening the survival of more than 1 million of the planet's estimated 8 million plant and animal species. A 2021 European Commission communication, ' Pathway to a healthy planet for all — EU Action Plan: \"Towards zero pollution for air, water and soil\" ', sets out an integrated vision for 2050, includes a list of actions that seek to reduce pollution at source and sets a series of targets to be achieved, in the first instance, by 2030. These targets include: improving air quality to reduce the number of premature deaths caused by air pollution by at least 55%; reducing the share of people chronically disturbed by transport noise by 30%; reducing by 25% the European Union (EU) ecosystems where air pollution threatens biodiversity; reducing by 50% nutrient losses, the use and risk of chemical pesticides, the use of the more hazardous ones, and the sale of antimicrobials for farmed animals and in aquaculture; reducing by 50% plastic litter at sea and by 30% microplastics released into the environment; significantly reducing total waste generation and reducing residual municipal waste by 50%. Some examples of initiatives and actions that will be taken under the plan: aligning EU air quality standards more closely to the latest World Health Organization recommendations; reviewing the standards for the quality of water, including in EU rivers and seas; reducing soil pollution and enhancing soil restoration; reviewing EU waste laws to reduce pollution and adapt to circular economy principles; fostering zero pollution from production and consumption; reducing health inequalities caused by the disproportionate share of harmful health impacts now borne by the most vulnerable; reducing the EU's external pollution footprint by restricting the export of products and wastes that have harmful or toxic impacts in non-EU countries.

The latter is excluded in order to avoid double-counting between the EU Institutions and EU Member States when adding up their respective ODA to obtain the total for Team Europe.
